             Notes, Definitions, and Abbreviations

There have been some significant changes in this edition. The
Literacy entry now includes rates for males, females, and both
sexes. Appendix C: International Organizations and Groups is new
and includes date established, aim, and list of members. Three maps
of special interest have been added this year--republics of the
Soviet Union, ethnic groups in the Soviet Union, and ethnic groups
in Eastern Europe.

_#_Administrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and
first-order administrative divisions are generally those approved by the
United States Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been
reported but not yet acted upon by BGN are noted.


_#_Area: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited
by international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the
aggregate of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or
coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).
Comparative areas are based on total area equivalents. Most entities
are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states. The smaller
entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 km2, 69 miles2) or
The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 km2, 0.23 miles2, 146 acres).


_#_Birth rate: The average annual number of births during a year
per 1,000 population at midyear. Also known as crude birth rate.


_#_Dates of information: In general, information available as of 1
January 1991 was used in the preparation of this edition. Population
figures are estimates for 1 July 1991, with population growth rates
estimated for mid-1991 through mid-1992. Major political events have
been updated through 30 June 1991. Military age figures are average
annual estimates for 1991-95.


_#_Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year
per l,000 population at midyear. Also known as crude death rate.


_#_Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic
relations with 162 nations. There are only 144 US embassies, since some
nations have US ambassadors accredited to them, but no physical US
mission exists. The US has diplomatic relations with 151 of the 159 UN
members--the exceptions are Angola, Belorussia (Byelorussia;
constituent republic of the Soviet Union), Cambodia, Cuba, Iran, Vietnam,
Ukraine (constituent republic of the Soviet Union) and, obviously, the US
itself. In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 12 nations that
are not in the UN--Andorra, Federated States of Micronesia, Kiribati,
Marshall Islands, Monaco, Nauru, San Marino, South Korea, Switzerland,
Tonga, Tuvalu, and the Vatican City. North Korea is not in the UN and the
US does not have diplomatic relations with that nation. The US has not
recognized the incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the
Soviet Union and continues to accredit the diplomatic representatives of
their last free governments.


_#_Disputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations
that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral
claims of one sort or another. Every international land boundary
dispute in the "Guide to International Boundaries," a map published
by the Department of State, is included. References to other situations
may also be included that are border- or frontier-relevant, such as
maritime disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.
However, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance
or recognition by the US Government.


_#_Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of:

Official Development Assistance (ODA), which is defined as government
grants that (a) are administered with the promotion of economic
development and welfare of LDCs as their main objective and (b) are
concessional in character and contain a grant element of at least 25%;
and

Other Official Flows (OOF) or transactions by the official sector
whose main objective is other than development-motivated or whose
grant element is below the 25% threshold for ODA. OOF transactions
include official export credits (such as Eximbank credits), official
equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the
official sector that does not meet concessional terms.

Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are
initialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration
of intent.


_#_Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special
sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not
independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US
Government. Nation refers to a people politically organized into a
sovereign state with a definite territory. Dependent area refers to a
broad category of political entities that are associated in some way
with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually the short-form
names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. The
long-form name is included in the Government section and an entry
of "none" indicates a long-form name does not exist. In some
instances, no short-form name exists--then the long-form name must
serve for all usages.

Notes: The US Government has not recognized the incorporation of
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania into the Soviet Union as constituent
republics during World War II. Those Baltic states are not members of the
UN and are not included in the list of nations. The US Government does
not recognize the four so-called "independent" homelands of
Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei, and Venda in South Africa.


_#_Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all goods and
services produced domestically.


_#_Gross national product (GNP): The value of all goods and
services produced domestically, plus income earned abroad, minus
income earned by foreigners from domestic production.


_#_GNP/GDP methodology: In the Economy section, GNP/GDP dollar
estimates for the OECD countries, the USSR, and the East European
countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP)
calculations rather than from conversions at official currency exchange
rates. The PPP method normally involves the use of international
dollar price weights, which are applied to the quantities of goods and
services produced in a given economy. In addition to the lack of
reliable data from the majority of countries, the statistician faces
a major difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing for the
quality of goods and services. The division of a PPP GNP/GDP estimate
in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives
the PPP conversion rate. One thousand dollars will buy the
same market basket of goods in the US as one thousand dollars, converted
to the local currency at the PPP conversion rate, will buy in the other
country. GNP/GDP estimates for the LDCs, on the other hand, are based on
the conversion of GNP/GDP estimates in local currencies to dollars at
the official currency exchange rates. One caution: the proportion of,
say, defense expenditures as a percent of GNP/GDP in local currency
accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when GNP/GDP
accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer
estimates the dollar level of Soviet or Japanese military expenditures;
similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under
currency exchange rate procedures. Finally, as academic research
moves forward on the PPP method, we hope to convert all GNP/GDP
estimates to this method in future editions of the Factbook.


_#_Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the
population, resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over
deaths and the balance of migrants entering and leaving a country.
The rate may be positive or negative.


_#_Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit
drugs--narcotics, stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens,
and cannabis. These categories include many drugs legally produced and
prescribed by doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold
outside medical channels.


  Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, provides
hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot,
Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol),
hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).


  Coca (Erythroxylon coca) is a bush and the leaves contain the stimulant
cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa which comes from cacao
seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter.


  Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.


  Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and
include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,
phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone
(Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,
Valmid).


  Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental,
emotional, or behavioral change in an individual.


  Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that
results in physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an
individual.


  Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,
self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot),
mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA,
STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues
(PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin, psilocyn).


  Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant
(Cannabis sativa).


  Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.


  Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant
(Cannabis sativa).


  Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to
opium, opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics
include opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),
codeine (Tylenol w/codeine, Empirin w/codeine, Robitussan A-C), and
thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and
hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or
Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose), and
others (Darvon, Lomotil).


  Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the
opium poppy.


  Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and
semisynthetic narcotics.


  Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried
opium poppy.


  Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis
that is chewed or drunk as tea.


  Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and
activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn,
Dexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and
others (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).


_#_Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one
year of age in a given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same
year.


_#_Land use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as
arable land--land cultivated for crops that are replanted after
each harvest (wheat, maize, rice); permanent crops--land
cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each harvest
(citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and pastures--land permanently
used for herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland--land under
dense or open stands of trees; and other--any land type not
specifically mentioned above (urban areas, roads, desert). The
percentage figure for irrigated refers to the portion of the entire
amount of land area that is artificially supplied with water.


_#_Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country
who represents the state at official and ceremonial funcions but is not
involved with the day-to-day activities of the government. The head
of government is the administrative leader who manages the day-to-day
activities of the government. In the UK, the monarch is the chief
of state and the prime minister is the head of government. In the US,
the President is both the chief of state and the head of government.


_#_Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived
by a group of people all born in the same year, if mortality at each
age remains constant in the future.


_#_Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of
literacy. Unless otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most
common definition--the ability to read and write at a specified age.
Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the
ability to read and write is beyond the scope of this publication.


_#_Maps: All maps will be available only in the printed version for
the foreseeable future.


_#_Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent
some national claims from being fully extended.


_#_Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All
commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which
excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. Also, a
grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register.

     Captive register--A register of ships maintained by a territory,
possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships
owned in the parent country. Also referred to as an offshore register,
the offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive
register will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local
variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation
rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive
register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent
country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned
abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience
register, except that it is not the register of an independent state.

     Flag of convenience register--A national register offering
registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major
flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their register by virtue
of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal
manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having
relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag
state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a
given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority
of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an
open register.

     Flag state--The nation in which a ship is registered and which
holds legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home
or abroad. Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine
how a ship is manned and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be
placed on the register.

     Internal register--A register of ships maintained as a subset of
a national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national
flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of
maritime rules from those on the main national register. These
differences usually include lower taxation of profits, manning by
foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag state
(when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International
Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most
notable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental
in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and in
attracting foreign-owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags.

     Merchant ship--A vessel that carries goods against payment of
freight. Commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately
restricted to commercial vessels only.

     Register--The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as
listed with the maritime authorities of a country. Also, the
compendium of such individual ships' registrations. Registration of
a ship provides it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws
of the country in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the
nationality of the ship's ultimate owner.


_#_Money figures: All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars

_#_Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons
entering and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons
(based on midyear population). An excess of persons entering the

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Fundamentally, Afghanistan is an extremely poor,
landlocked country, highly dependent on farming (wheat especially) and
livestock raising (sheep and goats). Economic considerations, however,
have played second fiddle to political and military upheavals, including
the nine-year Soviet military occupation (ended 15 February 1989) and the
continuing bloody civil war. Over the past decade, one-third of the
population has fled the country, with Pakistan sheltering about 3.3
million refugees and Iran about 1.3 million. Another 1 million have
probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan. Large
numbers of bridges, buildings, and factories have been destroyed or
damaged by military action or sabotage. Government claims
to the contrary, gross domestic product almost certainly is
lower than 10 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital
and the disruption of trade and transport.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: As the poorest country in Europe, Albania's development
lags behind even the least favored areas of the Yugoslav economy.
For over 40 years, the Stalinist-type economy has operated on the
principles of central planning and state ownership of the means of
production. In recent years Albania has implemented limited economic
reforms to stimulate its lagging economy, provide incentives, and
decentralize decisionmaking. In an effort to expand international
ties, Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the Soviet
Union and the US. The Albanians have also passed legislation allowing
foreign investment. Albania possesses considerable mineral
resources and, until 1990, was largely self-sufficient in food;
several years of drought have hindered agricultural development.
Numerical estimates of Albanian economic activity are subject to an
especially wide margin of error because the government until recently
did not release economic information.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The exploitation of oil and natural gas products forms
the backbone of the economy. Algeria depends on hydrocarbons for nearly
all of its export receipts, about 30% of government revenues, and nearly
25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in oil prices led to a booming
economy and helped to finance an ambitious program of industrialization.
Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the mismanagement of Algeria's
highly centralized economy, have brought the nation to its most serious
social and economic crisis since independence. The government has
promised far-reaching reforms, including giving public-sector companies
more autonomy, encouraging private-sector activity, boosting gas and
nonhydrocarbon exports, and proposing a major overhaul of the banking
and financial systems, but to date has made little progress.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The mainstay of Andorra's economy is tourism. An
estimated 12 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's
duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. Agricultural
production is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to
be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.
Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. The
rapid pace of European economic integration is a potential threat to
Andorra's advantages from its duty-free status.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for
80 to 90% of the population, but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil
production is the most lucrative sector of the economy, contributing
about 50% to GDP. In recent years, however, the impact of fighting an
internal war has severely affected the nonoil economy, and food has to be
imported.  For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural
resources, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land.  To realize its
economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace but also
must reform government policies that have led to distortions and
imbalances throughout the economy.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Anguilla has few natural resources, and the economy
depends heavily on lobster fishing, offshore banking, tourism, and
remittances from emigrants. In recent years the economy has benefited
from a boom in tourism. Development is planned to improve the

_#_Total area: about 14,000,000 km2; land area: about 14,000,000 km2


_#_Comparative area: slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US;
second-smallest continent (after Australia)


_#_Land boundaries: see entry on _#_Disputes


_#_Coastline: 17,968 km


_#_Maritime claims: see entry on _#_Disputes


_#_Disputes: Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctic Treaty
Summary below); sections (some overlapping) claimed by Argentina,
Australia, Chile, France (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Ross Dependency),
Norway (Queen Maud Land), and UK; Brazil has noted possible Latin claims;
the US and USSR do not recognize the territorial claims of other nations
and have made no claims themselves (but reserve the right to do so); no
formal claims have been made in the sector between 90o west and
150o west


_#_Climate: severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and
distance from the ocean; East Antarctica colder than West Antarctica
because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has most
moderate climate; warmest temperatures occur in January along the coast
and average slightly below freezing


_#_Terrain: about 98% thick continental ice sheet, with average
elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges up to 4,897
meters high; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria
Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and Ross Island on
McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves along about half of coastline
and floating ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent


_#_Natural resources: none presently exploited; coal and iron ore;
chromium, copper, gold, nickel, platinum, and hydrocarbons have been
found in small uncommercial quantities


_#_Land use: arable land 0%; permanent crops 0%; pastures 0%;
meadows and forest and woodland 0%; other 100% (ice 98%, barren rock
2%)


_#_Environment: mostly uninhabitable; katabatic (gravity) winds blow
coastward from the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot
of the plateau; cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise
around the coast, as does a circumpolar ocean current; during
summer more solar radiation reaches the surface at the South Pole than
is received at the Equator in an equivalent period; in April 1991 it was
reported that the ozone shield, which protects the Earth's surface from
harmful ultraviolet radiation, had dwindled to its lowest level ever over
Antarctica; subject to active volcanism (Deception Island and isolated
areas of West Antarctica); other seismic activity rare and weak

_#_Type: The Antarctic Treaty, signed on 1 December 1959 and entered
into force on 23 June 1961, established for at least 30 years a legal
framework for peaceful use, scientific research, and deferral of legal
questions regarding territorial claims. Administration is carried out
through consultative member meetings--the last meeting was held in Madrid
(Spain) in April 1991.


    Consultative (voting) members include seven nations that claim
portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and
nonclaimant nations. The US and other nations have made no claims, but
have reserved the right to claim territory. The US does not recognize the
claims of others. The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding
nation was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while no date
indicates an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations
are--Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the
UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations are--Belgium, Brazil (1983),
China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India
(1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru
(1989), Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay
(1985), the US, and the USSR.


    Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year of accession in parenthesis,
are--Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada (1988), Colombia (1988),
Cuba (1984), Czechoslovakia (1962), Denmark (1965), Greece (1987),
Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania
(1971), and Switzerland (1990).


    Antarctic Treaty Summary:

Article 1--area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military
activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel
and equipment may be used for peaceful scientific and logistics purposes;

Article 2--freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation
shall continue;

Article 3--free exchange of information and personnel in
cooperation with the UN and other international agencies;

Article 4--does not recognize, dispute, or establish territorial
claims and no new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force;

Article 5--prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive
wastes;

Article 6--includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves
south of 60o 00%19 south, but that the water areas be covered by
international law;

Article 7--treaty-state observers have free access, including
aerial observation, to any area and may inspect all stations,
installations, and equipment; advance notice of all activities
and the introduction of military personnel must be given;

Article 8--allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists
by their own states;

Article 9--frequent consultative meetings take place among
member nations;

Article 10--treaty states will discourage activities by any
country in Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty;

Article 11--disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties
concerned or, ultimately, by the ICJ;

Articles 12, 13, 14--deal with upholding, interpreting, and
amending the treaty among involved nations.


    Other agreements: more than 150 recommendations adopted at
treaty consultative meetings and ratified by governments
include--Agreed Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and
Flora (1964); Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972);
Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources
(1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but was
subsequently rejected by some signatories and is likely to be replaced in
1991 by a comprehensive environmental protection agreement that defers
minerals development for a long period.


_*_Economy
_#_Overview: No economic activity at present except for fishing off
the coast and small-scale tourism, both based abroad.  Exploitation of
mineral resources is unlikely because of technical difficulties, high
costs, and objections by environmentalists.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is primarily service oriented, with tourism
the most important determinant of economic performance. During the period
1983-89, real GDP expanded at an annual average rate of about 7%.
Tourism's contribution to GDP, as measured by value added tax in hotels
and restaurants, rose from about 14% in 1983 to 16% in 1989, and
stimulated growth in other sectors--particularly in construction,
communications, and public utilities. Antigua and Barbuda is one of the
few areas in the Caribbean experiencing a labor shortage in some sectors
of the economy.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly
literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a
diversified industrial base. Nevertheless, following decades of
mismanagement and statist policies, the economy has encountered
major problems in recent years, leading to escalating inflation and
a recession in 1988-90. A widening public-sector deficit and a
multidigit inflation rate have dominated the economy over the past
three years; retail prices rose nearly 5,000% in 1989 and another
1,345% in 1990. Since 1978, Argentina's external debt has nearly doubled
to $60 billion, creating severe debt-servicing difficulties and hurting
the country's creditworthiness with international lenders.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist
economy, with a per capita GNP comparable to levels in industrialized
West European countries. Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major
exporter of agricultural products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels.
Of the top 25 exports, 21 are primary products, so that, as happened
during 1983-84, a downturn in world commodity prices can have a big
impact on the economy. The government is pushing for increased exports
of manufactured goods but competition in international markets will be
severe.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Austria boasts a prosperous and stable capitalist
economy with a sizable proportion of nationalized industry and extensive
welfare benefits. Thanks to an excellent raw material endowment, a
technically skilled labor force, and strong links to West German
industrial firms, Austria has successfully occupied specialized niches
in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and produces almost
enough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force in
agriculture. Improved export prospects from German unification
and the opening of Eastern Europe will also boost the economy during
the next few years. Living standards are roughly comparable with the
large industrial countries of Western Europe. Problems for the l990s
include an aging population, the high level of subsidies, and the
struggle to keep welfare benefits within budget capabilities. Austria,
which has applied for EC membership, is currently involved in EC and
European Free Trade Association negotiations for a European Economic
Area and will have to adapt its economy to achieve freer movement of
goods, services, capital, and labor with the EC.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Bangladesh is one of the poorest nations in the world.
The economy is based on the output of a narrow range of
agricultural products, such as jute, which is the main cash crop and
major source of export earnings. Bangladesh is hampered by a relative
lack of natural resources, population growth of more than 2% a year,
large-scale unemployment, and a limited infrastructure; furthermore,
it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Despite these constraints,
real GDP growth averaged about 3.5% annually during 1985-89. A strong
agricultural performance in FY90 pushed the growth rate up to 5.5%.
Alleviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the government's
development strategy.

industry is now a major employer of the labor force and a primary source
of foreign exchange. An unemployment rate of 18% remains one of the most
serious economic problems facing the country.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: This small private-enterprise economy has capitalized
on its central geographic location, highly developed transport
network, and diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is
concentrated mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north, although
the government is encouraging reinvestment in the southern region
of Walloon. With few natural resources Belgium must import essential raw
materials, making its economy closely dependent on the state of world
markets. Over 70% of trade is with other EC countries. During
the period 1988-90 Belgium's economic performance was marked by buoyant
output growth, moderate inflation, and a substantial external surplus.
Real GDP grew by an average of 3.9% in 1988-90. However, the economy
is likely to slow in 1991-92 to below 3% GDP growth.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Benin is one of the least developed countries in the
world because of limited natural resources and a poorly developed
infrastructure. Agriculture accounts for almost 40% of GDP, employs
about 60% of the labor force, and generates a major share of foreign
exchange earnings. The industrial sector contributes only about 15% to
GDP and employs 2% of the work force. Persistently low prices in recent
years have limited hard currency earnings from Benin's major exports of
agricultural products and crude oil.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy, one of the world's least developed,
is based on agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood
for 90% of the population and account for about 50% of GDP. Rugged
mountains dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other
infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely
aligned with that of India through strong trade and monetary links.
Low wages in industry lead most Bhutanese to stay in agriculture.
Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on Indian
migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower potential and its attraction for
tourists are its most important natural resources.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The Bolivian economy steadily deteriorated between
1980 and 1985 as La Paz financed growing budget deficits by expanding
the money supply and inflation spiraled--peaking at 11,700%. An austere
orthodox economic program adopted by newly elected President Paz
Estenssoro in 1985, however, succeeded in reducing inflation to between
10% and 20% annually since 1987, eventually restarting economic growth.
President Paz Zamora has retained the economic policies of the previous
government, keeping inflation down and continuing the moderate growth
begun under his predecessor. Nevertheless, Bolivia continues to be one of
the poorest countries in Latin America, and it remains vulnerable to
price fluctuations for its limited exports--agricultural products,
minerals, and natural gas. Moreover, for many farmers, who constitute
half of the country's work force, the main cash crop is coca, which is
sold for cocaine processing.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy has historically been based on cattle raising
and crops. Agriculture today provides a livelihood for over 80% of the
population, but produces only about 50% of food needs and contributes
a small 3% to GDP. The driving force behind the rapid economic growth of
the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry. This sector, mostly on
the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating 25% of GDP in 1980 to
over 50% in 1989. No other sector has experienced such growth, especially
not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and poor soils. The
unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and
manufacturing sectors, entered the 1990s with declining real growth,
runaway inflation, an unserviceable foreign debt of $122 billion, and
a lack of policy direction. In addition, the economy remained highly
regulated, inward-looking, and protected by substantial trade and
investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and mining facilities
is divided among private interests--including several multinationals--and
the government. Most large agricultural holdings are private, with the
government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts between large
landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent violence.
The government is seeking an IMF standby loan despite several failed
agreements over the past decade. Relations with foreign commercial
banks remain strained because of mounting interest arrears on Brazil's
long-term debt. The Collor government, which assumed office in March
1990, is embarked on an ambitious reform program that seeks to
modernize and reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices,
deregulating the economy, and opening it to increased foreign
competition. A major long-run strength is Brazil's vast natural
resources.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Growth in the lackluster Bulgarian economy fell to the
2% annual level in the 1980s. By 1990 Sofia's foreign debt had
skyrocketed to over $10 billion--giving a debt service ratio of more
than 40% of hard currency earnings and leading the regime to declare
a moratorium on its hard currency payments. The post-Zhivkov regime
faces major problems of renovating an aging industrial plant;
coping with worsening energy, food, and consumer goods shortages;
keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments;
investing in additional energy capacity (the portion of electric
power from nuclear energy reached over one-third in 1990); and
motivating workers, in part by giving them a share in the earnings of
their enterprises. A major decree of January 1989 summarized and
extended the government's economic restructuring efforts, which include
a partial decentralization of controls over production decisions and
foreign trade. In October 1990 the Lukanov government proposed an
economic reform program based on a US Chamber of Commerce study. It was
never instituted because of a political stalemate between the BSP and the
UDF. The new Popov government launched a similar reform program in
January 1991, but full implementation has been slowed by continuing
political disputes.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Burma is a poor Asian country, with a per capita GDP
of about $400. The nation has been unable to achieve any substantial
improvement in export earnings because of falling prices for many
of its major commodity exports. For rice, traditionally the most
important export, the drop in world prices has been accompanied by
shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales. In 1985 teak replaced
rice as the largest export and continues to hold this position. The
economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, which generates
about half of GDP and provides employment for 66% of the work force.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage
of economic development, Burundi is predominately agricultural with only
a few basic industries. Its economic health depends on the coffee
crop, which accounts for an average 90% of foreign exchange earnings each
year. The ability to pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely
on the vagaries of the climate and the international coffee market.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Cambodia is a desperately poor country whose economic
development has been stymied by deadly political infighting. The
economy is based on agriculture and related industries.  Over the
past decade Cambodia has been slowly recovering from its near destruction
by war and political upheaval. It still remains, however, one of the
world's poorest countries, with an estimated per capita GDP of about
$130.  The food situation is precarious; during the 1980s famine has
been averted only through international relief. In 1986 the production
level of rice, the staple food crop, was able to meet only 80% of
domestic needs. The biggest success of the nation's recovery program has
been in new rubber plantings and in fishing. Industry, other than rice
processing, is almost nonexistent. Foreign trade is primarily with the
USSR and Vietnam. Statistical data on the economy continues to be sparse
and unreliable. Foreign aid from the USSR and Eastern Europe almost
certainly is being slashed.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Over the past decade the economy has registered a
remarkable performance because of the development of an offshore oil
industry. Real GDP growth annually averaged 10% from 1978 to 1985. In
1986 Cameroon had one of the highest levels of income per capita in
tropical Africa, with oil revenues picking up the slack as growth in
other sectors softened. Because of the sharp drop in oil prices, however,
the economy experienced serious budgetary difficulties and
balance-of-payments disequilibrium. Despite the recent upsurge in oil
prices, Cameroon's economic outlook is troubled. Oil reserves currently
being exploited will be depleted in the early 1990s, so ways must be
found to boost agricultural and industrial exports in the medium term.
The Sixth Cameroon Development Plan (1986-91) stresses balanced
development and designates agriculture as the basis of the country's
economic future.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada
today closely resembles the US in per capita output, market-oriented
economic system, and pattern of production. Since World War II the
impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has
transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one primarily
industrial and urban. In the 1980s Canada registered one of the highest
rates of real growth among the OECD nations, averaging about 3.2%. With
its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and modern capital
plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects. In mid-1990, however, the
long-simmering problems between English- and French-speaking areas
became so acute that observers spoke openly of a possible split in the
confederation; foreign investors were becoming edgy.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural
resource base, a 17-year drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is
service oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services
accounting for 65% of GDP during the period 1985-88. Although nearly
70% of the population lives in rural areas, agriculture's share of GDP is
only 16%; the fishing sector accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be
imported. The fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully
exploited. In 1988 fishing represented only 3.5% of GDP. Cape Verde
annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances from
emigrants and foreign aid.

_#_Agriculture: accounts for 16% of GDP; largely subsistence farming;
bananas are the only export crop; other crops--corn, beans, sweet
potatoes, coffee; growth potential of agricultural sector limited by

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The Central African Republic (CAR) had a per capita
income of roughly $440 in 1990. Subsistence agriculture, including
forestry, is the backbone of the economy, with over 70% of the population
living in the countryside. In 1988 the agricultural sector generated
about 40% of GDP. Agricultural products accounted for about 60% of export
earnings and the diamond industry for 30%. Important constraints to
economic development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor
transportation infrastructure, and a weak human resource base.
Multilateral and bilateral development assistance plays a major role in
providing capital for new investment.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The climate, geographic location, and lack of
infrastructure and natural resources potential make Chad one of the most
underdeveloped countries in the world. Its economy is burdened by
the ravages of civil war, conflict with Libya, drought, and food
shortages. In 1986 real GDP returned to its 1977 level, with cotton,
the major cash crop, accounting for 48% of exports. Over 80%
of the work force is employed in subsistence farming and fishing.
Industry is based almost entirely on the processing of agricultural
products, including cotton, sugarcane, and cattle. Chad is highly
dependent on foreign aid, with its economy in trouble and many regions
suffering from shortages. Oil companies are exploring areas north of
Lake Chad and in the Doba basin in the south.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: In 1990 economic growth slowed from an average of 6.2%
for the previous six years to about 1.5% as a result of tight monetary
policy aimed at reducing inflation. Monetary policy was not
successful at slowing price increases until the end of the year,
however, and inflation, stimulated by higher world oil prices,
increased to 27.3% in 1990 from 21.4% in 1989. Copper prices held strong
in 1990, helping to maintain a balance-of-payments surplus and increase
international reserves. Most observers expect that inflationary
pressures have run their course and price increases will slow during
1991, contributing to growth of 4-5%.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been
trying to move the economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally
planned economy to a more productive and flexible economy with market
elements--but still within the framework of monolithic Communist control.
To this end the authorities have switched to a system of household
responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization,
increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in
industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in services
and light manufacturing, and opened the foreign economic sector to
increased trade and joint ventures. The most gratifying result has been a
strong spurt in production, particularly in agriculture in the early
1980s. Otherwise, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid
system the worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude,
corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up inflation).
Beijing thus has periodically backtracked, retightening central controls
at intervals and thereby undermining the credibility of the reform
process. Popular resistance and changes in central policy have
weakened China's population control program, which is essential to the
nation's long-term economic viability.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Economic development has slowed gradually since 1986, but
growth rates remain high by Latin American standards. Conservative
economic policies have kept inflation and unemployment near 30% and 10%,
respectively. The rapid development of oil, coal, and other
nontraditional industries over the past four years has helped to offset
the decline in coffee prices--Colombia's major export. The collapse of
the International Coffee Agreement in the summer of 1989, a troublesome
rural insurgency, and drug-related violence dampen prospects for future
growth.

_#_Flag: green with a white crescent placed diagonally (closed side of
the crescent points to the upper hoist-side corner of the flag); there
are four white five-pointed stars placed in a line between the points of
the crescent; the crescent, stars, and color green are traditional
symbols of Islam; the four stars represent the four main islands of the
archipelago--Mwali, Njazidja, Nzwani, and Mayotte (which is a territorial
collectivity of France, but claimed by the Comoros)


_*_Economy
_#_Overview: One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made
up of several islands that have poor transportation links, a young and
rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low
educational level of the labor force contributes to a low level of
economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign
grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including fishing and
forestry, is the leading sector of the economy. It contributes about 40%
to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and provides most of the exports.
The country is not self-sufficient in food production, and rice, the main
staple, accounts for 90% of imports. During the period 1982-86 the
industrial sector grew at an annual average rate of 5.3%, but its
contribution to GDP was only 5% in 1988. Despite major investment in the
tourist industry, which accounts for about 25% of GDP, growth has
stagnated since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of 1.5% during 1985-90 has
led to large budget deficits, declining incomes, and balance-of-payments
difficulties.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the
economy, providing about two-thirds of government revenues and
exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo
to finance large-scale development projects with growth averaging 5%
annually, one of the highest rates in Africa. The world decline in
oil prices, however, has forced the government to launch an austerity
program to cope with declining receipts and mounting foreign debts.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export
earners are fruit, copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are
limited to a fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories.
Economic development is hindered by the isolation of the islands from
foreign markets and a lack of natural resources and good transportation
links. A large trade deficit is annually made up for by remittances from
emigrants and from foreign aid. Current economic development plans call
for exploiting the tourism potential and expanding the fishing industry.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: In 1990 the economy grew at an estimated 3.5%
rate, a decrease from the strong 5.0% gain of the previous year.
Gains in agricultural production (on the strength of good coffee and
banana crops) and in construction, were partially offset by lower
rates of growth for industry. In 1990 consumer prices rose by about 25%
and the trade deficit widened. Unemployment is officially reported at
6%, but much underemployment remains. External debt, on a per
capita basis, is among the world's highest.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy, centrally planned and largely state owned,
is highly dependent on the agricultural sector and foreign trade. Sugar
provides about 75% of export revenues and over half is exported to the
USSR. The economy has stagnated since 1985 under policies that have
deemphasized material incentives in the workplace, abolished farmers'
informal produce markets, and raised prices of government-supplied goods
and services. In 1990 the economy probably fell 3%, largely as a result
of declining trade with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Recently
the government has been trying to increase trade with Latin America and
China. Cuba has had difficulty servicing its foreign debt since 1982. The
government currently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist
facilities. Other investment priorities include sugar, basic foods, and
nickel. The annual $4 billion Soviet subsidy, a main prop to Cuba's
threadbare economy, is likely to show a substantial decline over the
next few years in view of the USSR's mounting economic problems. Instead
of highly subsidized trade, Cuba will be shifting to trade at market
prices in convertible currencies. In early 1991, the shortages of fuels,
spare parts, and industrial products in general had become so severe as
to amount to a deindustrialization process in the eyes of some observers.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Czechoslovakia is highly industrialized and has a
well-educated and skilled labor force. Its industry, transport, energy
sources, banking, and most other means of production are state owned. The
country is deficient, however, in energy and in many raw materials.
Moreover, its aging capital plant lags well behind West European
standards. Industry contributes almost 50% to GNP and construction
contributes 10%. About 95% of agricultural land is in collectives or
state farms. The centrally planned economy has been tightly linked in
trade (80%) to the USSR and Eastern Europe. Growth has been sluggish,
averaging less than 2% in the period 1982-89. GNP per capita is the
highest in Eastern Europe. As in the rest of Eastern Europe, the sweeping
political changes of 1989-90 have been disrupting normal channels of
supply and compounding the government's economic problems. Having eased
restrictions on private enterprise in 1990 and having adjusted some key
prices, Czechoslovakia is now implementing a broad two-year program
to make the difficult transition from a command to a market economy.
Inflation and unemployment are beginning to rise, albeit from
comparatively low levels.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: This modern economy features high-tech
agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate industry, extensive
government welfare measures, comfortable living standards, and high
dependence on foreign trade. The Danish economy is likely to maintain
its slow but steady improvement in 1991. GDP grew by 1.3% in 1990
and probably will grow by about 1.25% in 1991; unemployment is running
close to 10%. In 1990 Denmark had the lowest inflation rate in the EC,
a record trade surplus, and the first balance-of-payments surplus in
26 years. As the government prepares for the economic integration of
Europe during 1992, growth, investment, and competitiveness are expected
to improve, reducing unemployment, inflation, and debt.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is based on service activities connected with
the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in
northeast Africa. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port
for the region and an international transshipment and refueling center.
It has few natural resources and little industry. The nation is,
therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance to help support its
balance of payments and to finance development projects. An unemployment
rate of over 40% continues to be a major problem. Per capita
consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last five years with
a population growth rate of 6% (including immigrants and refugees) and a
recession.

_#_Industries: limited to a few small-scale enterprises, such as

_#_Agriculture: accounts for only 5% of GDP; scanty rainfall limits
crop production to mostly fruit and vegetables; half of population
pastoral nomads herding goats, sheep, and camels; imports bulk of food

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is dependent on agriculture and thus is
highly vulnerable to climatic conditions. Agriculture accounts for about
30% of GDP and employs 40% of the labor force. Principal products include
bananas, citrus, mangoes, root crops, and coconuts. In 1988 the economy
achieved a 5.6% growth in real GDP on the strength of a boost in
construction, higher agricultural production, and growth of the small
manufacturing sector based on the soap and garment industries. In 1989,
however, Hurricane Hugo wiped out 70% of the banana crop and affected
other economic activity. The tourist industry remains undeveloped because
of a rugged coastline and the lack of an international-class airport.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is largely dependent on trade; imported
components average 60% of the value of goods consumed in the domestic
market. Rapid growth of free trade zones has established a significant
expansion of manufacturing for export, especially wearing apparel.
Over the past decade tourism has also increased in importance and is a
major earner of foreign exchange and a source of new jobs. Agriculture
remains a key sector of the economy. The principal commercial crop is
sugarcane, followed by coffee, cotton, cocoa, and tobacco. Domestic
industry is based on the processing of agricultural products, durable
consumer goods, minerals, and chemicals. Unemployment is officially
reported at about 30%, but there is considerable underemployment. An
increasing foreign debt burden and galloping inflation are the economy's
greatest weaknesses.

agricultural areas.  Growth has been uneven because of natural disasters
(e.g., a major earthquake in 1987), fluctuations in global oil prices,
and government policies designed to curb inflation.  The government has
not taken a supportive attitude toward either domestic or foreign
investment, although its agreement to enter the Andean free trade zone
is an encouraging move.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all
the Third World economies, most industrial plants being owned by the
government. Overregulation holds back technical modernization and
foreign investment. Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late
1970s and early 1980s, but in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices
and an increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to begin
negotiations with the IMF for balance-of-payments support. As part of
the 1987 agreement with the IMF, the government agreed to institute
a reform program to reduce inflation, promote economic growth, and
improve its external position. The reforms have been slow in coming,
however, and the economy has been largely stagnant for the past
three years. The addition of 1 million people every seven months
to Egypt's population exerts enormous pressure on the 5% of the total
land area available for agriculture.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy, destroyed during the regime of former
President Macias Nguema, is now based on agriculture, forestry,
and fishing, which account for about 60% of GNP and nearly all exports.

products providing income, foreign exchange, and government
revenues. There is little industry. Commerce accounts
for about 10% of GNP, and the construction, public works, and service
sectors for about 34%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium,
iron ore, manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold.  Oil exploration,
taking place under concessions offered to US, French, and Spanish firms,
has been moderately successful, and some revenues from oil exports
will begin rolling in by mid-1991.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Ethiopia is one of the poorest and least developed
countries in Africa. Its economy is based on subsistence agriculture,
which accounts for about 45% of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total
employment; coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The
manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs from the agricultural
sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but less then 10% of

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is based on sheep farming, which directly or
indirectly employs most of the work force. A few dairy herds are kept to
meet domestic consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are
primarily those for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments
of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins.
Rich stocks of fish in the surrounding waters are not presently exploited
by the islanders. So far efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry
have been unsuccessful. In 1987 the government began selling
fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating within the Falklands
exclusive fishing zone. These license fees amount to more than $40
million per year and are a primary source of income for the
government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development
Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the
abundant wildlife and trout fishing.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The Faroese, who have long been enjoying the affluent
living standards of the Danes and other Scandinavians,
now must cope with the decline of the all-important fishing
industry and with an external debt twice the size of annual
income. When the nations of the world extended their fishing
zones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese
no longer could continue their traditional long-distance fishing
and subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas; one
estimate foresaw a 25% drop in fish catch in 1990 alone. Half the
fishing fleet is for sale, and the 22 fish-processing plants work
at only half capacity. The government no longer can maintain its
high level of spending on roads and tunnels, hospitals, sports
facilities, and other social welfare programs.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large
subsistence sector. Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange
and sugar processing accounts for one-third of industrial output.
Industry, including sugar milling, contributes 13% to GDP. Fiji
traditionally had earned considerable sums of hard currency from the
250,000 tourists who visited each year. In 1987, however, after two
military coups, the economy went into decline. GDP dropped by 7.8% in
1987 and by another 2.5% in 1988; political uncertainty created a drop in
tourism, and the worst drought of the century caused sugar production
to fall sharply. In contrast, sugar and tourism turned in strong
performances in 1989, and the economy rebounded vigorously. In 1990
the economy received a setback from cyclone Sina which cut sugar
output by an estimated 21%.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market
economy, with per capita output nearly three-fourths the US figure.
Its main economic force is the manufacturing sector--principally
the wood, metals, and engineering industries. Trade is important, with
the export of goods representing about 30% of GDP. Except for timber and
several minerals, Finland depends on imported raw materials, energy, and
some components of manufactured goods. Because of the climate,
agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in
basic commodities. The economy, which experienced an average of 4.9%
annual growth between 1987 and 1989, leveled off in 1990 and is now
in a recession facing negative growth in 1991. The clearing account
system between Finland and the Soviet Union in the postwar period--mainly
Soviet oil and gas for Finnish manufactured goods--had kept Finland
isolated from world recessions; the system, however, was dismantled on
1 January 1991 in favor of hard currency trade. As a result, Finland must
increase its competitiveness in certain sectors, for example, textiles,
foodstuffs, paper, and metals, and has already begun to shift trade
westward. Finland, as a member of EFTA, is negotiating a European
Economic Area arrangement with the EC which would allow for free
movement of capital, goods, services, and labor within the organization.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: One of the world's most developed economies, France
has substantial agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern
industrial sector. Large tracts of fertile land, the application of
modern technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading
agricultural producer in Western Europe. France is largely
self-sufficient in agricultural products and is a major exporter of
wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector generates about
one-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has become crucial
to the economy. After sluggish growth during the period 1982-87, the
economy expanded at a rapid 3.8% pace in 1988-89. The economy
slowed down in 1990, with growth of 2.0% expected in 1991.
The economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new
entrants into the labor force, resulting in a high unemployment rate,
which probably will rise to around 10% during the slowdown.
The steadily advancing economic integration within the European
Community is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic
sectors.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is tied closely to that of France through
subsidies and imports. Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing
and forestry are the most important economic activities, with exports
of fish and fish products (mostly shrimp) accounting for more than 60%
of total revenue in 1987. The large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not
fully exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn
logs for export. Cultivation of crops--rice, cassava, bananas, and
sugarcane--are limited to the coastal area, where the population is
largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily dependent on imports
of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem, particularly
among younger workers.

_#_Overview: The economy, dependent on timber and manganese until
the early 1970s, is now dominated by the oil sector. During the period
1981-85 oil accounted for about 46% of GDP, 83% of export earnings, and
65% of government revenues on average. The high oil prices of the early
1980s contributed to a substantial increase in per capita income,
stimulated domestic demand, reinforced migration from rural to urban
areas, and raised the level of real wages to among the highest in
Sub-Saharan Africa. The three-year slide of Gabon's economy, which
began with falling oil prices in 1985, was reversed in 1989 because of a
near doubling of oil prices over their 1988 lows. In 1990 the economy
continued to grow, but debt servicing problems are hindering economic
advancement. The agricultural and industrial sectors are relatively
underdeveloped, except for oil.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural
resources and has a limited agricultural base. It is one of the world's
poorest countries with a per capita income of about $230. About 75%
of the population is engaged in crop production and livestock raising,
which contributes 30% to GDP. Small-scale manufacturing
activity--processing peanuts, fish, and hides--accounts for less than
10% of GDP. Tourism is a growing industry. The Gambia imports
one-third of its food, all fuel, and most manufactured goods. Exports
are concentrated on peanut products (about 75% of total value).


_#_GDP: $195 million, per capita $230; real growth rate 6.0% (FY90

_@_Gaza Strip
_#_Note: The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967
ended with Israel in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the
Sinai, and the Golan Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords
and reaffirmed by President Reagan's 1 September 1982 peace initiative,
the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship
with their neighbors, and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to
be negotiated among the concerned parties. Camp David further specifies
that these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries. Pending
the completion of this process, it is US policy that the final status of
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined. In the view of
the US, the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the Jordan
under Jordanian administration before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. With
respect to negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement, however, it
is US policy that a distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the
rest of the West Bank because of the city's special status and
circumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for the final status of
Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the rest of the
West Bank.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Nearly half the labor force of the Gaza Strip is
employed across the border by Israeli industrial, construction, and
agricultural enterprises, with worker transfer funds accounting for 46%
of GNP in 1990. The once dominant agricultural sector now contributes
only 13% to GNP, about the same as that of the construction sector, and
industry accounts for 7%. Gaza depends upon Israel for 90% of its
imports and as a market for 80% of its exports. Unrest in the territory
in 1988-91 (intifadah) has raised unemployment and substantially
lowered the incomes of the population. Furthermore, the Persian Gulf
crisis dealt a severe blow to the Gaza Strip in 1990 and on into 1991.
Worker remittances from the Gulf states have plunged, unemployment has
increased, and export revenues have fallen dramatically. The risk of
malnutrition is a real possibility in 1991.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The newly unified German economy presents a starkly
contrasting picture. Western Germany has an advanced market economy
and is a leading exporter. It experienced faster-than-projected real
growth largely because of demand in eastern Germany for western German
goods. Western Germany has a highly urbanized and skilled population
which enjoys excellent living standards, abundant leisure time, and
comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western Germany is relatively
poor in natural resources, coal being the most important mineral.
Western Germany's world-class companies manufacture technologically
advanced goods. The region's economy is mature: manufacturing and service
industries account for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw
materials and semimanufactured products constitute a large proportion of
imports. In 1989 manufacturing accounted for 31% of GDP, with other
sectors contributing lesser amounts. In recent years, gross fixed
investment has accounted for about 21% of GDP. In 1990 GDP in the western
region was an estimated $16,300 per capita.

    In contrast, eastern Germany's obsolete command economy, once
dominated by smokestack heavy industries, has been undergoing a
wrenching change to a market economy. Industrial production in early
1991 is down 50% from the same period last year, due largely to the
slump in domestic demand for eastern German-made goods and the ongoing
economic restructuring. The FRG's legal, social welfare, and economic
systems have been extended to the east, but economic
restructuring--privatizing industry, establishing clear property rights,
clarifying responsibility for environmental clean-up, and removing
Communist-era holdovers from management--is proceeding slowly
so far, deterring outside investors. The region is one of the world's
largest producers of low-grade lignite coal, but has few other resources.
The quality of statistics from eastern Germany remains poor; Bonn is
still trying to bring statistics for the region in line with West German
practices.

    The most challenging economic problem of a united Germany is the
reconstruction of eastern Germany's economy--specifically, finding the
right mix of fiscal, regulatory, monetary, and tax policies that
will spur investment in the east without derailing western Germany's
healthy economy or damaging relations with Western partners. The
biggest danger is that soaring unemployment in eastern Germany, which
could climb to the 30 to 40% range, could touch off labor disputes
or renewed mass relocation to western Germany and erode investor
confidence in eastern Germany. Overall economic activity grew an
estimated 4.6% in western Germany in 1990, while dropping roughly 15% in
eastern Germany. Per capita GDP in the eastern region was approximately
$8,700 in 1990.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana
has been implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983,
including moves toward privatization and relaxation of government
controls. Heavily dependent on cocoa, gold, and timber exports,
economic growth is threatened by a poor cocoa harvest and higher oil
prices in 1991. Rising inflation--unofficially estimated at 50%--could
undermine Ghana's relationships with multilateral lenders. Civil service
wage increases and the cost of peacekeeping forces sent to Liberia are
boosting government expenditures and undercutting structural adjustment
reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in 1990.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Greece has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic
entrepreneurial system overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist government
that enlarged the public sector from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70%
when Prime Minister Mitsotakis took office. Mitsotakis inherited several
severe economic problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker
governments, which neglected the runaway budget deficit, a ballooning
current account deficit, and accelerating inflation. With only a
two-seat majority in the Chamber of Deputies, Mitsotakis has concentrated
on cutting the public-sector payroll, cautiously expanding the tax base,
and adopting guidelines for privatizing Greece's loss-ridden state-owned
enterprises. Once the political situation is sorted out, Greece will have
to face the challenges posed by the steadily increasing integration of
the European Community, including the progressive lowering of trade and
investment barriers. Tourism continues as a major industry, providing a
vital offset to the sizable commodity trade deficit.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Over the past 25 years, the economy has changed from
one based on subsistence whaling, hunting, and fishing to one dependent
on foreign trade. Fishing is still the most important industry,
accounting for over 75% of exports and about 25% of the
population's income. Maintenance of a social welfare system similar to
Denmark's has given the public sector a dominant role in the economy.
In 1990, the economy became critically dependent on shrimp exports and an
annual subsidy (now about $355 million) from the Danish Government
because cod exports had fallen, the zinc and lead mine closed, and
a large promising platinum and gold mine was not yet operational.
Greenland has signed a contract for its largest construction project,
a power plant to supply the capital. To avoid a decline in the economy,
Denmark has agreed to pay 75% of the costs of running Sondrestrom
Airbase and Kulusuk Airfield as civilian bases after the US withdraws
in 1992.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is essentially agricultural and centers on
the traditional production of spices and tropical plants. Agriculture
accounts for about 16% of GDP and 80% of exports and employs 24% of the
labor force. Tourism is the leading foreign exchange earner, followed by
agricultural exports. Manufacturing remains relatively undeveloped, but
is expected to grow, given a more favorable private investment climate
since 1983. Despite an impressive average annual growth rate for the
economy of 5.6% during the period 1986-90, unemployment remains high
at about 25%.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light
industry, and services. It is also dependent upon France for large
subsidies and imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from
the US. In addition, an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit
the islands. The traditionally important sugarcane crop is slowly being
replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50% of
export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root crops
are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is still
dependent on imported food, which comes mainly from France. Light
industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production. Most manufactured
goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially high among the
young.

labor force. In 1990 the economy grew by 3.5%, the fourth consecutive
year of mild growth. Government economic policies, however, were erratic
in 1990--an election year--and inflation shot up to 60%, the highest
level in modern times.

development. The government's four-year plan (1988-91) has targeted
agricultural development as the top priority.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: After growing on average at less than 1% a year in
1986-87, GDP dropped by 3% a year in 1988-89. The decline resulted from
bad weather, labor trouble in the canefields, and flooding and equipment
problems in the bauxite industry. Consumer prices rose about 35% in 1988
and by over 100% in 1989, and the current account deficit widened
substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell. Moreover, electric
power is in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains
in national output. The government, in association with international
financial agencies, seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new
funds. The government's stabilization program--aimed at establishing
realistic exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a resumption of
growth--requires considerable public administrative abilities and
continued patience by consumers during a long incubation period.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western
Hemisphere. Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy,
accounts for nearly 30% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and
produces two-thirds of exports. Productivity remains low. Industry,
still in its early stages, employs nearly 9% of the labor force,
accounts for 15% of GDP, and generates 20% of exports. The service
sectors, including public administration, account for 50% of GDP and
employ nearly 20% of the labor force.  Basic problems facing the
economy include rapid population growth, high unemployment, sharply
increased inflation, a lack of basic services, a large and inefficient
public sector, and the dependence of the export sector mostly on coffee
and bananas, which are subject to sharp price fluctuations. Despite
government efforts at reform and large-scale foreign assistance, the
economy still is unable to take advantage of its sizable natural
resources.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Hong Kong has a free market economy with few tariffs
or nontariff barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw
materials must be imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 18% of
GDP, employs 28% of the labor force, and exports about 90% of its
output. Real GDP growth averaged a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, then
slowed to 2.5-3.0% in 1989-90. Unemployment, which has been declining
since the mid-1980s, is now less than 2%. A shortage of labor continues
to put upward pressure on prices and the cost of living. Short-term
prospects remain solid so long as major trading partners continue to be
prosperous. The crackdown in China in 1989-90 casts a long shadow over
the longer term economic outlook.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Agriculture is an important sector, providing sizable
export earnings and meeting domestic food needs. Industry accounts for
about 40% of GNP and 30% of employment. About 40% of Hungary's foreign
trade is with the USSR and Eastern Europe and a third is with the EC.
Low rates of growth reflect the inability of the Soviet-style economy to
modernize capital plant and motivate workers. GNP declined by 1% in 1989
and by an estimated 6% in 1990. Since 1985 external debt has more than
doubled, to over $20 billion. In recent years Hungary has experimented
widely with decentralized and market-oriented enterprises. The newly
democratic government has renounced the Soviet economic growth model and
plans to open the economy to wider market forces and to much closer
economic relations with Western Europe. Prime Minister Antall has
declared his intention to move foward on privatization of state
enterprises, provision for bankruptcy, land reform, and marketization of
international trade, but concerns over acceptable levels of unemployment
and inflation may slow the reform process.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Iceland's prosperous Scandinavian-type economy is
basically capitalistic, but with extensive welfare measures, low
unemployment, and comparatively even distribution of income. The economy
is heavily dependent on the fishing industry, which provides nearly 75%
of export earnings. In the absence of other natural resources, Iceland's
economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. As a result of
climbing fish prices in 1990 and a noninflationary labor agreement,
Iceland is pulling out of a recession, which began in mid-1988 with a
sharp decline in fish prices and an imposition of quotas on fish catches
to conserve stocks. Inflation was down sharply from 20% in 1989
to 8% in 1990.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: India's economy is a mixture of traditional
village farming and handicrafts, modern agriculture, old and new branches
of industry, and a multitude of support services. It presents both the
entrepreneurial skills and drives of the capitalist system and
widespread government intervention of the socialist mold. Growth of 4%
to 5% annually in the 1980s has softened the impact of population growth
on unemployment, social tranquility, and the environment. Agricultural
output has continued to expand, reflecting the greater use of modern
farming techniques and improved seed that have helped to make India
self-sufficient in food grains and a net agricultural exporter. However,
tens of millions of villagers, particularly in the south, have not
benefited from the green revolution and live in abject poverty. Industry
has benefited from a partial liberalization of controls. The growth rate
of the service sector has also been strong. India, however, has been
challenged more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves, higher
inflation, and a large debt service burden.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The Indian Ocean provides a major transportation highway
for the movement of petroleum products from the Middle East to Europe
and North and South American countries. Fish from the ocean are of
growing economic importance to many of the bordering countries as a
source of both food and exports. Fishing fleets from the USSR, Japan,
Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean for mostly shrimp and
tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the offshore
areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western Australia. An estimated
40% of the world's offshore oil production comes from the Indian Ocean.
Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are
actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly India, South
Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist
institutions and central planning but with a recent emphasis on
deregulation and private enterprise. Indonesia has extensive natural
wealth yet, with a large and rapidly increasing population, it remains a
poor country. GDP growth in 1985-89 averaged about 4%, somewhat short of
the more than 5% rate needed to absorb the 2.3 million workers annually
entering the labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is
an important sector, accounting for 21% of GDP and over 50% of the labor
force. The staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice importer,
Indonesia is now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops--rubber and
palm oil--and textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export
and job generation. Industrial output now accounts for 30% of GDP
based on a supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil,
natural gas, timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector dominates
the external economy, generating more than 20% of the government's
revenues and 40% of export earnings in 1989. However, the economy's
growth is very dependent on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports.
Japan is Indonesia's most important customer and supplier of aid.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Since the 1979 revolution, the banks, petroleum industry,
transportation, utilities, and mining have been nationalized, but the
new five-year plan--the first since the revolution--passed in January
1990, calls for the transfer of many government-controlled enterprises
to the private sector. Disruptions from the bitter war with Iraq,
massive corruption, mismanagement, demographic pressures, and ideological
rigidities have kept economic growth at depressed levels. Oil accounts
for over 90% of export revenues. A combination of war damage and low oil
prices brought a 2% drop in GNP in 1988. GNP probably rose slightly in
1989, considerably short of the 3.2% population growth rate in 1989.
Heating oil and gasoline are rationed. Agriculture has suffered from the
war, land reform, and shortages of equipment and materials. The five-year
plan seeks to reinvigorate the economy by increasing the role of the
private sector, boosting nonoil income, and securing foreign loans. The
plan is overly ambitious but probably will generate some short-term
relief.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The Bathist regime engages in extensive central
planning and management of industrial production and foreign trade while
leaving some small-scale industry and services and most agriculture to
private enterprise. The economy has been dominated by the oil sector,
which has provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s
financial problems, caused by massive expenditures in the eight-year
war with Iran and damage to oil export facilities by Iran, led the
government to implement austerity measures and to borrow heavily and
later reschedule foreign debt payments. After the end of hostilities in
1988, oil exports gradually increased with the construction of new
pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities. Agricultural development
remained hampered by labor shortages, salinization, and dislocations
caused by previous land reform and collectivization programs. The
industrial sector, although accorded high priority by the government,
also was under financial constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August
1990, subsequent international economic embargoes, and military actions
by an international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically
changed the economic picture. Oil exports were cut to near zero,
and industrial and transportation facilities severely damaged.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is small, open, and trade dependent.
Agriculture, once the most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry,
which accounts for 37% of GDP and about 80% of exports and employs 26%
of the labor force. The government has successfully reduced the rate of
inflation from double-digit figures in the late 1970s to 3.3% in
1990. In 1987, after years of deficits, the balance of payments was
brought into the black. Unemployment, however, is a serious problem. A
1990 unemployment rate of 16.6% placed Ireland along with Spain as the
countries with the worst jobless records in Western Europe.

_#_Note: The Arab territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war
are not included in the data below. As stated in the 1978 Camp David
Accords and reaffirmed by President Reagan's 1 September 1982 peace
initiative, the final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, their
relationship with their neighbors, and a peace treaty between Israel
and Jordan are to be negotiated among the concerned parties. The Camp
David Accords further specify that these negotiations will resolve the
location of the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this
process, it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip has yet to be determined (see West Bank and Gaza Strip
entries). On 25 April 1982 Israel relinquished control of the Sinai to
Egypt. Statistics for the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights are included in

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Israel has a market economy with substantial government
participation. It depends on imports for crude oil, food, grains, raw
materials, and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources,
Israel has developed its agricultural and industrial sectors on an
intensive scale over the past 20 years. Industry accounts for about 23%
of the labor force, agriculture for 5%, and services for most of the
balance. Diamonds, high-technology machinery, and agricultural products
(fruits and vegetables) are the biggest export earners. The balance of
payments has traditionally been negative, but is offset by large transfer
payments and foreign loans. About half of Israel's $18 billion external
government debt is owed to the US, which is its major source for economic
and military aid. To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel must continue
to exploit high-technology niches in the international market, such as
medical scanning equipment. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on 2 August dealt
a blow to Israel's economy in 1990. Higher world oil prices added an
estimated $300 million to Israel's 1990 oil import bill, and helped
keep the inflation rate at 18% for the year. Regional tensions
and continuing acts of the Palestinian uprising
(intifadah)-related violence contributed to a sharp dropoff in
tourism--a key source of foreign exchange--to the lowest level since the
1973 Arab-Israeli war. In 1991, the influx of up to 400,000 Soviet
immigrants will increase unemployment, intensify the country's
housing crisis, and contribute to a widening budget deficit.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Since World War II the economy has changed from one based
on agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the
same total and per capita output as France and the UK. The country is
still divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by small
private companies, and an undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by
large public enterprises. Services account for 48% of GDP, industry 34%,
agriculture 4%, and public administration 13%. Most raw materials needed
by industry and over 75% of energy requirements must be imported. The
economic recovery that began in mid-1983 has continued through 1990, with
the economy growing at an annual average rate of 3%. For the 1990s, Italy
faces the problems of refurbishing a tottering communications system,
curbing pollution in major industrial centers, and adjusting to the new
competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic integration of the
European Community.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Ivory Coast is among the world's largest producers
and exporters of coffee, cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently,
the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices
for coffee and cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the
government to diversify, the economy is still largely dependent on
agriculture and related industries. The agricultural sector accounts for
over one-third of GDP and about 80% of export earnings and employs about
85% of the labor force. A collapse of world cocoa and coffee prices in
1986 threw the economy into a recession, from which the country had not
recovered by 1990.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is based on sugar, bauxite, and tourism.
In 1985 it suffered a setback with the closure of some facilities in the
bauxite and alumina industry, a major source of hard currency earnings.
Since 1986 an economic recovery has been under way. In 1987 conditions
began to improve for the bauxite and alumina industry because of
increases in world metal prices. The recovery has also been supported by
growth in the manufacturing and tourism sectors. In September 1988,
Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on crops and the electric power
system, a sharp but temporary setback to the economy. By October 1989 the
economic recovery from the hurricane was largely complete and real growth
was up about 3% for 1989. In 1990, 3.5% economic growth was led by
mining and tourism.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Although Japan has few natural resources, since 1971 it
has become the world's third-largest economy, ranking behind only the
US and the USSR. Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic,
and a comparatively small defense allocation have helped Japan advance
rapidly, notably in high-technology fields. Industry, the most important
sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
fuels. Self-sufficent in rice, Japan must import 50% of its requirements
for other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the world's
largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global
catch. Overall economic growth has been spectacular: a 10% average in the
1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1990 strong investment and
consumption spending helped maintain growth at 5.6%. Inflation remains
low at 3.1% despite higher oil prices and rising wages because of a
tight labor market. Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus, $52
billion in 1990, which supports extensive investment in foreign
properties.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is based largely on financial services,
agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially
flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey
breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents an important
export earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986
the finance sector overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP,
accounting for 40% of the island's output. In recent years the government
has encouraged light industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that
an electronics industry has developed alongside the traditional
manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material and energy requirements are
imported, as well as a large share of Jersey's food needs.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Jordan was a secondary beneficiary of the oil boom of
the late 1970s and early 1980s, when its annual GNP growth averaged
10-12%. Recent years, however, have witnessed a sharp reduction in grant
aid from Arab oil-producing countries and a dropoff in worker
remittances, with national growth averaging 1-2%. Imports--mainly oil,
capital goods, consumer durables, and foodstuffs--have been outstripping
exports by roughly $2 billion annually, the difference being made up by
aid, remittances, and borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian Government
agreed to implement an IMF austerity program designed to tackle the
country's serious economic problems. The program sought to gradually
reduce the government's budget deficit over the next several years and
implement badly needed structural reforms in the economy. In return for
agreeing to the IMF program, Jordan was granted IMF standby loans of over
$100 million. Recognizing that it would be unable to cover its debt
obligations, the government also began debt rescheduling negotiations
with creditors in mid-1989. The onset of the Gulf crisis in August 1990
forced the government to shelve the IMF program and suspend most debt
payments and rescheduling negotiations. Economic prospects for 1991
are especially gloomy, given the unsettled conditions in the Middle
East.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The country has few national resources. Commercially
viable phosphate deposits were exhausted at the time of independence
in 1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production and exports.
The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP declined
about 8% in 1987, as the fish catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the
level of 1986 and copra production was hampered by repeated rains. Output
rebounded strongly in 1988, with real GDP growing by 17%. The upturn in
economic growth came from an increase in copra production and a good fish
catch. Following the strong surge in output in 1988, GNP increased 1%
in 1989 and again in 1990.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: More than 90% of this command economy is socialized;
agricultural land is collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95%
of manufactured goods. State control of economic affairs is unusually
tight even for a Communist country because of the small size and
homogeneity of the society and the strict one-man rule of Kim. Economic
growth during the period 1984-90 averaged approximately 3%. Abundant
natural resources and hydropower form the basis of industrial
development. Output of the extractive industries includes coal, iron ore,
magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals.
Manufacturing emphasis is centered on heavy industry, with light industry
lagging far behind. Despite the use of high-yielding seed varieties,
expansion of irrigation, and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea
has not yet become self-sufficient in food production. Four consecutive
years of poor harvests, coupled with distribution problems, have led to
chronic food shortages. North Korea remains far behind South Korea in
economic development and living standards.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The driving force behind the economy's dynamic growth
has been the planned development of an export-oriented economy in a
vigorously entrepreneurial society. Real GNP--which grew by 6.7% in 1989
after an average annual growth of over 12% between 1986-88--grew about
9% in 1990. Labor unrest--which led to substantial wage hikes in
1987-88--was noticeably calmer in 1990, unemployment averaged a low
2.5%, and investment was strong. Inflation rates, however, are beginning
to challenge South Korea's strong economic performance. Consumer prices
rose 8.6%, the highest rate in nine years. Policymakers are concerned
higher prices could lead to a resurgence of labor unrest.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Up to the invasion by Iraq in August 1990, the oil
sector had dominated the economy. Kuwait has the third-largest
oil reserves in the world after Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Earnings from
hydrocarbons generated over 90% of both export and government revenues
and contributed about 40% to GDP. Most of the nonoil sector has
traditionally been dependent upon oil-derived government revenues.
Iraq's destruction of Kuwait's oil industry during the Gulf war
has devastated the economy. Iraq destroyed or damaged more than 80%
of Kuwait's 950 operating oil wells, as well as sabotaging key surface
facilities. Western firefighters had brought about 140 of the 600
oil well fires and blowouts under control as of early June 1991.
It could take two to three years to restore Kuwait's oil production to
its prewar level of about 2.0 million barrels per day.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: One of the world's poorest nations, Laos has had a
Communist centrally planned economy with government ownership and control
of productive enterprises of any size. Recently, however, the government
has been decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise.
Laos is a landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure, that is,
it has no railroads, a rudimentary road system, limited external and
internal telecommunications, and electricity available in only a
limited area. Subsistence agriculture is the main occupation,
accounting for over 60% of GDP and providing about 85-90% of
total employment. The predominant crop is rice. For the foreseeable
future the economy will continue to depend for its survival on foreign
aid from the IMF and other international sources; foreign aid from the
USSR and Eastern Europe is being cut sharply.

_*_Government
_#_Note: Between early 1975 and late 1976 Lebanon was torn by civil
war between its Christians--then aided by Syrian troops--and its Muslims
and their Palestinian allies. The cease-fire established in October
1976 between the domestic political groups generally held for about six
years, despite occasional fighting. Syrian troops constituted as the Arab
Deterrent Force by the Arab League have remained in Lebanon. Syria's
move toward supporting the Lebanese Muslims and the Palestinians and
Israel's growing support for Lebanese Christians brought the two sides
into rough equilibrium, but no progress was made toward national
reconciliation or political reforms--the original cause of the war.


    Continuing Israeli concern about the Palestinian presence in
Lebanon led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982. Israeli
forces occupied all of the southern portion of the country and mounted a
summer-long siege of Beirut, which resulted in the evacuation of the
PLO from Beirut in September under the supervision of a multinational
force (MNF) made up of US, French, and Italian troops.


    Within days of the departure of the MNF, Lebanon's newly elected
president, Bashir Gemayel, was assassinated. In the wake of his death,
Christian militiamen massacred hundreds of Palestinian refugees in two
Beirut camps. This prompted the return of the MNF to ease the security
burden on Lebanon's weak Army and security forces. In late March 1984
the last MNF units withdrew.


    Lebanese Parliamentarians met in Taif, Saudi Arabia in late 1989
and concluded a national reconciliation pact that codified a new
power-sharing formula, specifiying a Christian president but giving
Muslims more authority. Rene Muawad was subsequently elected president on
4 November 1989, ending a 13-month period during which Lebanon had no
president and rival Muslim and Christian governments. Muawad was
assassinated 17 days later, on 22 November; on 24 November Ilyas Harawi
was elected to succeed Muawad.


    In October 1990, the chances for ending the 16 year old civil war
and implementing Ta'if were markedly improved when Syrian and Lebanese
forces ousted renegade Christian General Awn from his stronghold in East
Beirut. Awn had defied the legitimate government and established a
separate mini-state within East Beirut after being appointed acting
Prime Minister by outgoing President Gemayel in 1988. Awn and his
supporters feared Ta'if would diminish Christian power in Lebanon
and increase the influence of Syria.


    Since the removal of Awn, the Lebanese Government has reunited the
capital city and implemented a phased plan to disarm the militias
and gradually reestablish authority throughout Lebanon. The army has
deployed from Beirut north along the coast road to Tripoli, southeast
into the Shuf mountains, and south to the vicinity of Sidon. Many
militiamen from Christian and Muslim groups have evacuated Beirut
for their strongholds in the north, south, and east of the country.
Some heavy weapons possessed by the militias have been turned over to
the government, which has begun a plan to integrate some militiamen
into the military and the internal security forces.


    Lebanon and Syria signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation in
May 1991. Lebanon continues to be partially occupied by Syrian troops,
which are deployed in East and West Beirut, its southern suburbs,
the Bekaa Valley, and throughout northern Lebanon.


    Iran also maintains a small contingent of revolutionary guards
in the Bekaa Valley and South Lebanon to support Lebanese Islamic
fundamentalist groups.


    Israel withdrew the bulk of its forces from the south in 1985,
although it still retains troops in a 10-km-deep security zone north
of its border with Lebanon. Israel arms and trains the Army of South
Lebanon (ASL), which also occupies the security zone and is Israel's
first line of defense against attacks on its northern border.

and customary practices of the Lebanese system.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Since 1975 civil war has seriously damaged Lebanon's
economic infrastructure, disrupted economic activity, and all but ended
Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub.
Following October 1990, however, a tentative peace has enabled the
central government to begin restoring control in Beirut, collect taxes,
and regain access to key port and government facilities. The battered
economy has also been propped up by a financially sound banking system
and resilient small- and medium-scale manufacturers. Family remittances,
foreign financial support to political factions, the narcotics trade, and
international emergency aid are main sources of foreign exchange.
Economic prospects for 1991 have brightened, particularly if the
Syrian-backed government is able to maintain law and order and
reestablish business confidence. Rebuilding war-ravaged Beirut is likely
to provide a major stimulus to the Lebanese economy in 1991.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no
important natural resources other than water. Its economy is based on
agriculture, light manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed
in South Africa ($153 million in 1989). The great majority of households
gain their livelihoods from subsistence farming and migrant labor.
Manufacturing depends largely on farm products to support the milling,
canning, leather, and jute industries; other industries include textile,
clothing, and light engineering. Industry's share of GDP rose from
6% in 1982 to 15% in 1989. Political and economic instability in South
Africa raise uncertainties for Lesotho's economy, especially with respect
to migrant worker remittances--over one-third of GDP.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Civil war during 1990 destroyed much of Liberia's
economy, especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Expatriate
businessmen fled the country, taking capital and expertise with them.
Many will not return. Richly endowed with water, mineral resources,
forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a
producer and exporter of basic products, while local manufacturing,
mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope. Political instability
threatens prospects for economic reconstruction and repatriation of
some 750,000 Liberian refugees who fled to neighboring countries.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon
revenues from the oil sector, which contributes practically all export
earnings and about one-third of GNP. Since 1980, however, the sharp
drop in oil prices and the resulting decline in export revenues have
adversely affected economic development. In 1988 per capita GNP was the
highest in Africa at $5,410, but it had been $2,000 higher in 1982.
Severe cutbacks in imports over the past five years have led to shortages
of basic goods and foodstuffs, although the reopening of the
Libyan-Tunisian border in April 1988 and the Libyan-Egyptian border in
December 1989 have somewhat eased shortages. Austerity budgets and a lack
of trained technicians have undermined the government's ability to
implement a number of planned infrastructure development projects.
Windfall profits from the hike in world oil prices in late 1990 improved
the foreign payments position and may permit Tripoli to ease austerity
measures. The nonoil industrial and construction sectors, which account
for about 22% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly agricultural
products to include petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. Although
agriculture accounts for less than 5% of GNP, it employs 18% of the labor
force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm output,
requiring Libya to import about 75% of its food requirements.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The prosperous economy is based primarily on small-scale
light industry and tourism. Industry accounts for 54% of total
employment, the service sector 42% (mostly based on tourism), and
agriculture and forestry 4%. The sale of postage stamps to collectors is
estimated at $10 million annually. Low business taxes (the maximum tax
rate is 20%) and easy incorporation rules have induced about 25,000
holding or so-called letter box companies to establish nominal offices in
Liechtenstein. Such companies, incorporated solely for tax purposes,
provide 30% of state revenues. The economy is tied closely to that of
Switzerland in a customs union, and incomes and living standards parallel
those of the more prosperous Swiss groups.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The stable economy features moderate growth, low
inflation, and negligible unemployment. Agriculture is based on small but
highly productive family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until
recently dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified,
particularly toward high-technology firms. During the past decade, growth
in the financial sector has more than compensated for the decline in
steel. Services, especially banking, account for a growing proportion
of the economy. Luxembourg participates in an economic union with
Belgium on trade and most financial matters and is also closely connected
economically to the Netherlands.

agricultural products and textile manufacturing; in 1990 it accounted for
only 16% of GDP and employed 3% of the labor force. In 1986 the
government introduced a five-year development plan that stresses
self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by 1990, increased production for
exports, and reduced energy imports.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: A landlocked country, Malawi ranks among the world's
least developed with a per capita GDP of $175. The economy is
predominately agricultural and operates under a relatively free
enterprise environment, with about 90% of the population living in
rural areas. Agriculture accounts for 40% of GDP and 90% of export
revenues. After two years of weak performance, economic growth improved
significantly in 1988-90 as a result of good weather and a broadly based
economic adjustment effort by the government. The economy depends on
substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World Bank,
and individual donor nations. The closure of traditional trade routes
through Mozambique continues to be a constraint on the economy.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: In 1988-90 booming exports helped Malaysia continue to
recover from the severe 1985-86 recession. Real output grew by 8.8% in
1989 and 10% in 1990, helped by vigorous growth in manufacturing
output, further increases in foreign direct investment, particularly
from Japanese and Taiwanese firms facing higher costs at home, and
increased oil production in 1990. Malaysia has become the world's
third-largest producer of semiconductor devices (after the US and Japan)
and the world's largest exporter of semiconductor devices. Inflation
remained low as unemployment stood at 6% of the labor force and as
the government followed prudent fiscal/monetary policies. The country is
not self-sufficient in food, and some of the rural population subsists at
the poverty level. Malaysia's high export dependence leaves it
vulnerable to a recession in the OECD countries or a fall in world
commodity prices.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is based on fishing, tourism, and shipping.
Agriculture is limited to the production of a few subsistence crops that
provide only 10% of food requirements. Fishing is the largest industry,
employing 25% of the work force and accounting for over 60% of exports;
it is also an important source of government revenue. During the 1980s
tourism has become one of the most important and highest growth sectors
of the economy. In 1988 industry accounted for about 5% of GDP. Real
GDP is officially estimated to have increased by about 10% annually
during the period 1974-87, and GDP estimates for 1988 show a further
growth of 9% on the strength of a record fish catch and an improved
tourist season.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Significant resources are limestone, a favorable
geographic location, and a productive labor force. Malta produces only
about 20% of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has no
domestic energy sources. Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on
foreign trade and services. Manufacturing and tourism are the largest
contributors to the economy. Manufacturing accounts for about 27% of GDP,
with the electronics and textile industries major contributors. In 1989
inflation was held to a low 0.9%. Per capita GDP at $5,500 places Malta
in the middle-income range of the world's nations.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key
sectors of the economy. The government's policy of offering incentives to
high-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on the
island has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in high-income
industries. As a result, agriculture and fishing, once the mainstays of
the economy, have declined in their shares of GNP. Banking now
contributes over 20% to GNP and manufacturing about 15%. Trade is mostly
with the UK.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Agriculture and tourism are the mainstays of the economy.
Agricultural production is concentrated on small farms, and the most
important commercial crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and
breadfruit. A few cattle ranches supply the domestic meat market.
Small-scale industry is limited to handicrafts, fish processing, and
copra. The tourist industry is the primary source of foreign exchange and
employs about 10% of the labor force. The islands have few natural
resources, and imports far exceed exports. In 1987 the US Government
provided grants of $40 million out of the Marshallese budget of
$55 million.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism, and
light industry. Agriculture accounts for about 12% of GDP and the small
industrial sector for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of
the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana exports are
increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and
grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a chronic trade
deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from France. Tourism
has become more important than agricultural exports as a source of
foreign exchange. The majority of the work force is employed in the
service sector and in administration. In 1986 per capita GDP was
relatively high at $6,000. During 1986 the unemployment rate was 30% and
was particularly severe among younger workers.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: A majority of the population still depends on agriculture
and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many
subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in
the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore that
account for almost 50% of total exports. The decline in world demand for
this ore, however, has led to cutbacks in production. The nation's
coastal waters are among the richest fishing areas in the world, but
overexploitation by foreigners threatens this key source of revenue. The
country's first deepwater port opened near Nouakchott in 1986. In recent
years, the droughts, the conflict with Senegal, rising energy costs,
and economic mismanagement have resulted in a substantial buildup of
foreign debt. The government now has begun the second stage of an
economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank, the IMF,
and major donor countries.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Mexico's economy is a mixture of state-owned industrial
plants (notably oil), private manufacturing and services, and both
large-scale and traditional agriculture. In the 1980s Mexico experienced
severe economic difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts
as world petroleum prices fell; rapid population growth outstripped the
domestic food supply; and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to
emigrate became more acute. Growth in national output, however,
appears to be recovering, rising from 1.4% in 1988 to 3.9% in 1990.
The US is Mexico's major trading partner, accounting for two-thirds of
its exports and imports. After petroleum, border assembly plants and
tourism are the largest earners of foreign exchange. The government, in
consultation with international economic agencies, is implementing
programs to stabilize the economy and foster growth. In 1991 the
government also plans to begin negotiations with the US and Canada on a
free trade agreement.

of revenue, with the US pledged to spend $1 billion in the islands in the

relief funds for Micronesia because of damage from Typhoon Russ.
In addition Micronesia earns about $4 million a year in fees from foreign
commercial fishing concerns. Economic activity consists primarily of
subsistence farming and fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits
worth exploiting, except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a
tourist industry exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack of
adequate facilities hinder development.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast, is a
popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate.
The Principality has successfully sought to diversify into services and
small, high-value-added, non-polluting industries. The state has no
income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax haven both for
individuals who have established residence and for foreign companies that
have set up businesses and offices. About 50% of Monaco's annual revenue
comes from value-added taxes on hotels, banks, and the industrial sector;
about 25% of revenue comes from tourism. Living standards are high, that
is, roughly comparable to those in prosperous French metropolitan
suburbs.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Economic activity traditionally has been based on
agriculture and the breeding of livestock--Mongolia has the highest
number of livestock per person in the world. In recent years extensive
mineral resources have been developed with Soviet support. The mining and
processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold
account for a large part of industrial production. In early 1991 the
Mongolian leadership was struggling with severe economic dislocations,
mainly attributable to chaotic economic conditions in the USSR, by
far Mongolia's leading trade and development partner. For example,
the government doubled most prices in January 1991, and industrial
production dropped 10% in the first quarter of 1991. Moscow almost
certainly will be cutting aid in 1991.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy recovered moderately in 1990 because
of the resolution of a trade dispute with India over phosphoric
acid sales, a rebound in textile sales to the EC, and lower prices for
food imports. In addition, a dramatic increase in worker remittances,
increased Arab donor aid, and generous debt rescheduling agreements
helped ease foreign payments pressures. On the down side, higher oil
import costs fueled inflation. Servicing the $21 billion foreign debt,
high unemployment, and Morocco's vulnerability to external forces
remain severe problems for the 1990s.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: One of Africa's poorest countries, with a per capita GDP
of little more than $100, Mozambique has failed to exploit the economic
potential of its sizable agricultural, hydropower, and transportation
resources. Indeed, national output, consumption, and investment declined
throughout the first half of the 1980s because of internal disorders,
lack of government administrative control, and a growing foreign debt.
A sharp increase in foreign aid, attracted by an economic reform policy,
has resulted in successive years of economic growth since 1985.
Agricultural output, nevertheless, is at about only 75% of its 1981
level, and grain has to be imported. Industry operates at only 20-40% of
capacity. The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep
afloat.


_#_GDP: $1.6 billion, per capita $110; real growth rate 5.0%

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is heavily dependent on the mining industry
to extract and process minerals for export. Mining accounts for almost
30% of GDP. Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in
Africa and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial
diamond deposits are among the richest in the world, making Namibia a
primary source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large
quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver, and tungsten, and it has
substantial resources of coal. More than half the population depends
on agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves
of which are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have
given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third
World--$10,000 annually. Few other resources exist so
most necessities must be imported, including fresh water from
Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of income
from phosphates constitute serious long-term problems. Substantial
investment in trust funds, out of phosphate income, will help cushion the
transition.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries
in the world with a per capita income of less than $200. Real growth
averaged 4% in the 1980s until FY89, when it plunged to 1.5% because of
a trade/transit dispute with India. Though the impasse is over,
political turmoil and inflated energy costs will probably constrain
growth to under 4%. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy,
providing a livelihood for over 90% of the population and
accounting for 60% of GDP. Industrial activity is limited, mainly
involving the processing of agricultural produce (jute, sugarcane,
tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has expanded
recently and accounted for 87% of foreign exchange earnings in FY89.
Apart from agricultural land and forests, the only other exploitable
natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural
production in the late 1980s grew by about 5%, compared
with a population growth of 2.6%. Forty percent or more of the
population is undernourished partly because of poor distribution.
Economic prospects for the 1990s are poor, with economic growth
probably outpacing population growth only slightly.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: This highly developed and affluent economy is based on
private enterprise. The government makes its presence felt, however,
through many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare programs
affecting most aspects of economic activity. The trade and financial
services sector contributes over 50% of GDP. Industrial activity
provides about 25% of GDP and is led by the food-processing,
oil-refining, and metalworking industries. The highly mechanized
agricultural sector employs only 5% of the labor force, but provides
large surpluses for export and the domestic food-processing industry.
An unemployment rate of 6.8% and a sizable budget deficit are
currently the most serious economic problems.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an
agrarian economy dependent on a guaranteed British market to an open
free market economy that can compete on the global scene. The government
has hoped that dynamic growth would boost real incomes, reduce
inflationary pressures, and permit the expansion of welfare benefits. The
results have been mixed: inflation is down from double-digit levels
but growth has been sluggish and unemployment, always a highly sensitive
issue, has been at a record high 7.4%. In 1988 GDP fell by 1%, in
1989 grew by a moderate 2.4%, and was flat in 1990.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Government control of the economy historically has been
extensive, although the Chamorro government has pledged to reduce it.
The financial system is directly controlled by the state, which also
regulates wholesale purchasing, production, sales, foreign trade, and
distribution of most goods. Over 50% of the agricultural and industrial
firms are state owned. Sandinista economic policies and the war
have produced a severe economic crisis. The foundation of the economy
continues to be the export of agricultural commodities, largely coffee
and cotton. Farm production fell by roughly 7% in 1989, the fifth
successive year of decline. The agricultural sector employs 44%
of the work force and accounts for 23% of GDP and 86% of export earnings.
Industry, which employs 13% of the work force and contributes about
25% to GDP, showed a drop of 7% in 1989 and remains below
pre-1979 levels. External debt is one of the highest in the world on a
per capita basis. In 1990 the annual inflation rate was 11,800%, sharply
up from 1,800% in 1989.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: About 90% of the population is engaged in farming and
stock rearing, activities which generate almost half the national
income. The economy also depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium
deposits. Uranium production grew rapidly in the mid-1970s, but tapered
off in the early 1980s, when world prices declined. France is a major
customer, while Germany, Japan, and Spain also make regular purchases.
The depressed demand for uranium has contributed to an overall
sluggishness in the economy, a severe trade imbalance, and a mounting
external debt.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Although Nigeria is Africa's leading oil-producing
country, it remains poor with a $280 per capita GDP. In 1990, despite
rising oil prices and a sharp drop in inflation, performance remained
slack with continuing underutilization of industrial capacity and a
second year of relatively weak agricultural performance. Agricultural
production was up only 4.2% in 1990, still below the 1987 level.
Industrial output showed a 7.2% increase, but remained below the 1985
level. Government efforts to reduce Nigeria's dependence on oil exports
and to sustain noninflationary growth have fallen short due to inadequate
new investment funds. Living standards continue to deteriorate from the
higher level of the early 1980s oil boom.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New
Zealand. Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the
shortfall made up by grants from New Zealand--the grants are used to pay
wages to public employees. The agricultural sector consists mainly of
subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export.
Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit,
lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign
collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent years
has suffered a serious loss of population because of migration of Niueans
to New Zealand.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Norway is a prosperous capitalist nation with the
resources to finance extensive welfare measures. Since 1975 exploitation
of large crude oil and natural gas reserves has helped maintain high
growth; for the past five years growth has averaged 4.1%, the
fourth-highest among OECD countries. Growth slackened in 1987-88
partially because of the sharp drop in world oil prices, but picked
up again in 1989. The Brundtland government plans to push hard on
environmental issues, as well as cutting unemployment, improving
child care, upgrading major industries, and negotiating an
EC - European Free Trade Association (EFTA) agreement on an Economic
European Area.

bodies


_#_Comparative area: slightly less than 18 times the size of the US;
the largest ocean (followed by the Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, and
Arctic Ocean); covers about one-third of the global surface; larger than
the total land area of the world


_#_Coastline: 135,663 km


_#_Climate: the western Pacific is monsoonal--a rainy season occurs
during the summer months, when moisture-laden winds blow from the ocean
over the land, and a dry season during the winter months, when dry winds
blow from the Asian land mass back to the ocean


_#_Terrain: surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise,
warm water gyre (broad, circular system of currents) and in the southern
Pacific by a counterclockwise, cool water gyre; sea ice occurs in the
Bering Sea and
Sea of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from
Antarctica in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is
dominated by the East Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is
dissected by deep trenches; the world's greatest depth is 10,924 meters
in the Marianas Trench


_#_Natural resources: oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand
and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, fish


_#_Environment: endangered marine species include the dugong, sea
lion, sea otter, seals, turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine
Sea and South China Sea; dotted with low coral islands and rugged
volcanic islands in the southwestern Pacific Ocean; subject to tropical
cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east Asia from May to December (most
frequent from July to October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form
south of Mexico and strike Central America and Mexico from June to
October (most common in August and September); southern shipping lanes
subject to icebergs from Antarctica; occasional El Nino phenomenon
occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade winds slacken and the warm
Equatorial Countercurrent moves south, which kills the plankton that is
the primary food source for anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move
to better feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds to starve by the
thousands because of their lost food source


_#_Note: the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama
Canal, Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the
Pacific Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean;
ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme north from October to
May and in extreme south from May to October; persistent fog in the
northern Pacific from June to December is a hazard to shipping;
surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and earthquake activity
sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire


_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world
economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch.
It provides cheap sea transportation between East and West, extensive
fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and
gravel for the construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the
world's total fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only
ocean where the fish catch has increased every year since 1978.
Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an
ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia, New Zealand,
China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas,
combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has
slowed but not stopped new drillings.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Pakistan is a poor Third World country faced with the
usual problems of rapidly increasing population, sizable government
deficits, and heavy dependence on foreign aid. In addition, the economy
must support a large military establishment and provide for the needs of
4 million Afghan refugees. A real economic growth rate averaging 5-6% in
recent years has enabled the country to cope with these problems. Almost
all agriculture and small-scale industry is in private hands, and the
government seeks to privatize a portion of the large-scale industrial
enterprises now publicly owned. In December 1988, Pakistan signed a
three-year economic reform agreement with the IMF, which provides for a
reduction in the government deficit and a liberalization of trade in
return for further IMF financial support. Late in 1990, the IMF
suspended assistance to Pakistan because the government failed to
follow through on deficit reforms. Pakistan almost certainly will make
little headway on raising living standards for its rapidly expanding
population; at the current rate of growth, population would double in
29 years.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: GDP expanded by an estimated 5% in 1990, after
contracting 1% in 1988 and 14% in 1989. Political stability prompted
greater business confidence and consumer demand, leading to increased
production by the agricultural, commercial, manufacturing, construction,
and utilities sectors. The transportation sector and government services
declined slightly due to slack early-1990 transits through the Panama
Canal, lower oil pipeline flowthrough, and Panama City's budget cuts.
Imports and exports posted gains during the year, and government revenues
were up sharply over 1989's levels.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is predominantly agricultural. Agriculture,
including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GNP, employs about 45% of
the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay has no known
significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined
compared with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an
average annual rate of nearly 11%.  During 1982-86 real GDP fell in three
of five years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and
foreign debt rose. Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the
economy were the completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather
for crops, and weak international commodity prices for agricultural
exports. In 1987 the economy experienced a minor recovery because of
improved weather conditions and stronger international prices for key
agricultural exports. The recovery continued through 1990, on the
strength of bumper crops in 1988-89. The government, however, must
follow through on promises of reforms needed to deal with escalating
inflation, large fiscal deficits, growing debt arrearages, and falling
reserves.

_*_Government
_#_Long-form name: Republic of Peru


_#_Type: republic


_#_Capital: Lima


_#_Administrative divisions: 24 departments (departamentos,
singular--departamento) and 1 constitutional province*
(provincia constitucional); Amazonas, Ancash, Apurimac, Arequipa,

Junin, La Libertad, Lambayeque, Lima, Loreto, Madre de Dios,
Moquegua, Pasco, Piura, Puno, San Martin, Tacna, Tumbes, Ucayali;
note--the 1979 Constitution and legislation enacted from 1987 to
1990 mandate the creation of regions (regiones, singular--region)
intended to function eventually as autonomous economic and
administrative entities; so far, 12 regions have been constituted
from 23 existing departments--Amazonas (from Loreto), Andres
Avelino Caceres (from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from
Arequipa), Chavin (from Ancash), Grau (from Tumbes, Piura), Inca
(from Cusco, Madre de Dios, Apurimac), La Libertad (from La Libertad),
Los Libertadores-Huari (from Ica, Ayacucho, Huancavelica), Mariategui
(from Moquegua, Tacna, Puno), Nor Oriental del Maranon (from
Lambayeque, Cajamarca, Amazonas), San Martin (from San Martin),
Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation of another region has been delayed by
the reluctance of the constitutional province of Callao to merge with the
department of Lima; because of inadequate funding from the central
government, the regions have yet to assume their reponsibilities and at
the moment co-exist with the departmental structure

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The Peruvian economy is basically capitalistic, with a
large dose of government welfare programs and government management of
credit. In the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation,
declining per capita output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut
off from IMF and World Bank support in the mid-1980s because of its
huge debt arrears. An austerity program implemented shortly after the
Fujimori government took office in July 1990 contributed to a third
consecutive yearly contraction of economic activity, but was able to
generate a small recovery in the last quarter. After a burst of
inflation as the program eliminated government price subsidies, monthly
price increases eased to the single-digit level for the first time
since mid-1988. Lima has restarted current payments to multilateral
lenders and, although it faces $14 billion in arrears on its external
debt, is working toward an accommodation with its creditors.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy, except for the agricultural sector, had
followed the Soviet model of state ownership and control of
productive assets. About 75% of agricultural production had come from the
private sector and the rest from state farms. The economy has presented a
picture of moderate but slowing growth against a background of underlying
weaknesses in technology and worker motivation. GNP dropped by 2.0% in
1989 and by a further 8.9% in 1990. The inflation rate, after falling
sharply from the 1982 peak of 100% to 22% in 1986, rose to a galloping
rate of 640% in 1989 and dropped back to 250% in 1990. Shortages of
consumer goods and some food items worsened in 1988-89. Agricultural
products and coal are among the biggest hard currency earners, but
manufactures are increasing in importance. Poland, with its hard currency
debt of $48.5 billion, is severely limited in its ability to import
much-needed hard currency goods. The sweeping political changes of 1989
disrupted normal economic channels and exacerbated shortages. In January
1990, the new Solidarity-led government adopted a cold turkey program for
transforming Poland to a market economy. The government moved to
eliminate subsidies, free prices, make the zloty convertible, and,
in general, halt the hyperinflation. These financial measures were
accompanied by plans to privatize the economy in stages. While inflation
fell to an annual rate of 77.5% by November of 1990, the rise in
unemployment and the drop in living standards have led to growing popular
discontent and to a change of government in January 1991. The new
government is continuing the previous government's economic
program, while trying to speed privatization and to better cushion the
populace from the dislocations associated with reform. Substantial
outside aid will be needed if Poland is to make a successful transition
in the 1990s.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: During the past four years, the economy has made a
sustained recovery from the severe recession of 1983-85. The economy
grew by 14% during the 1987-89 period, largely because of strong
domestic consumption and investment spending. Unemployment has
declined for the third consecutive year, but inflation continues to be
about three times the European Community average. The government is
pushing economic restructuring and privatization measures in anticipation
of the 1992 European Community timetable to form a single large market in
Europe.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the
Caribbean region. Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary
sector of economic activity and income. Encouraged by duty-free
access to the US and by tax incentives, US firms have invested heavily
in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. Important new industries include
pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles, petrochemicals, and processed
foods. Sugar production has lost out to dairy production and other
livestock products as the main source of income in the agricultural
sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of income
for the island. The economy is slowly recovering from the disruptions
caused by Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. The tourism infrastructure
was especially hard hit.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture.
Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a century, and in some
years it accounts for 85% of exports. The government has been pushing
the development of a tourist industry to relieve high unemployment,
which recently amounted to one-third of the labor force. The white
and Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments
of the population, adding to the social tensions generated by poverty
and unemployment. The economic well-being of Reunion depends heavily on
continued financial assistance from France.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Industry, which accounts for one-third of the labor force
and generates over half the GNP, suffers from an aging capital plant and
persistent shortages of energy. The year 1990 witnessed about a 20%
drop in industrial production because of energy and input shortages and
labor unrest. In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend
with drought, mismanagement, and shortages of inputs. A drought in 1990
contributed to a lackluster harvest, a problem compounded by corruption
and a poor distribution system. The new government is slowly loosening
the tight central controls of Ceausescu's command economy. It has
instituted moderate land reforms, with close to one-half of cropland now
in private hands, and it has allowed changes in prices for private
agricultural output. Also, the new regime is permitting the
establishment of private enterprises, largely in services, handicrafts,
and small-scale industry. New laws providing for the privatization
of large state firms have been passed. However, most of the early
privatization will involve converting state firms into joint-stock
companies. The selling of shares to the public has not yet been worked
out. Furthermore, the government has halted the old policy of diverting
food from domestic consumption to hard currency export markets. So far,
the government does not seem willing to adopt a thoroughgoing market
system, that is, there is great caution in decontrolling prices because
of public opposition. The government has sharply raised price ceilings
instead of lifting them entirely.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector;
coffee and tea make up 80-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile
land is limited, however, and deforestation and soil erosion have created
problems. The industrial sector in Rwanda is small, contributing only
16% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of
agricultural products. The Rwandan economy remains dependent on coffee
exports and foreign aid, with no relief in sight. Weak international
prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita
GDP to decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank
began in October 1990. An outbreak of insurgency, also in October, has
dampened any prospects for economic improvement.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Since 1983 the economy has shown an impressive average
annual growth rate of almost 5% because of strong agricultural and
tourist sectors. Saint Lucia also possesses an expanding
industrial base supported by foreign investment in manufacturing and
other activities, such as in data processing. The economy, however,
remains vulnerable because the important agricultural sector is dominated
by banana production. Saint Lucia is subject to periodic droughts and/or
tropical storms, and its protected market agreement with the UK for
bananas may end in 1992.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The inhabitants have traditionally earned their
livelihood by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the
coast of Newfoundland. The economy has been declining, however, because
the number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over
the years. In March 1989, an agreement between France and Canada set fish
quotas for Saint Pierre's trawlers fishing in Canadian and
Canadian-claimed waters for three years. The agreement settles a
longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish exports to a halt.
The islands are heavily subsidized by France. Imports come primarily from
Canada and France.

a growing tourist industry, is also important. The economy continues to
have a high unemployment rate of 30% because of an overdependence on the
weather-plagued banana crop as a major export earner. Government progress
toward diversifying into new industries has been relatively unsuccessful.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the
country gained independence nearly 15 years ago. Since then, however,
cocoa production has gradually deteriorated because of drought and
mismanagement, so that by 1987 output had fallen to less than 50% of
its former levels. As a result, a shortage of cocoa for export has
created a serious balance-of-payments problem. Production of less
important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm kernels, has
also declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of
exports by a ratio of 4 to 1. The emphasis on cocoa production at
the expense of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import
90% of food needs. It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured
goods. Over the years, Sao Tome has been unable to service its external
debt, which amounts to roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable
potential exists for development of a tourist industry, and the
government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The
government also implemented a Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to
restructure the economy and reschedule external debt service payments in
cooperation with the International Development Association and Western
lenders.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The agricultural sector accounts for about 20% of GDP and
provides employment for about 75% of the labor force. About 40% of the
total cultivated land is used to grow peanuts, an important export crop.
The principal economic resource is fishing, which brought in about $200
million or about 25% of total foreign exchange earnings in 1987. Mining
is dominated by the extraction of phosphate, but production has faltered
because of reduced worldwide demand for fertilizers in recent years. Over
the past 10 years tourism has become increasingly important to the
economy.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economic and social infrastructure is not well
developed. Subsistence agriculture dominates the economy, generating
about one-third of GDP and employing about two-thirds of the working
population. Manufacturing accounts for less than 10% of GDP, consisting
mainly of the processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for
the domestic market. Diamond mining provides an important source of hard
currency. The economy suffers from high unemployment, rising inflation,
large trade deficits, and a growing dependency on foreign assistance.
The government in 1990 was attempting to get the budget deficit under
control and, in general, to bring economic policy in line with the
recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong
service and manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading
links derived from its entrepot history. During the 1970s and early
1980s, the economy expanded rapidly, achieving an average annual growth
rate of 9%. Per capita GDP is among the highest in Asia. In 1985 the
economy registered its first drop in 20 years and achieved less than a 2%
increase in 1986. Recovery was strong based on rising demand for
Singapore's products in OECD countries and improved competitiveness of
domestic manufactures. The economy grew 8.3% in 1990. Singapore's
position as a major oil refining and services center helped it weather
the Persian Gulf crisis.

the economy, with the livestock sector accounting for about 40% of GDP
and about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are
dependent upon livestock for their livelihoods make up more than half
of the population. Crop production generates only 10% of GDP and employs
about 20% of the work force. The main export crop is bananas; sugar,
sorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic market. The small industrial
sector is based on the processing of agricultural products and accounts
for less than 10% of GDP. Serious economic problems facing the nation are
the external debt of $1.9 billion and double-digit inflation.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Many of the white one-seventh of the South African
population enjoy incomes, material comforts, and health and educational
standards equal to those of Western Europe. In contrast, most of the
remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of the Third
World, including unemployment, lack of job skills, and barriers to
movement into higher-paying fields. Inputs and outputs thus do not move
smoothly into the most productive employments, and the effectiveness
of the market is further lowered by international constraints on
dealings with South Africa. The main strength of the economy lies in
its rich mineral resources, which provide two-thirds of exports.
Average growth of less than 2% in output in recent years falls far short
of the 5-6% level needed to cut into the high unemployment rate.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The first six years of perestroyka (economic and
political restructuring) have undermined the institutions and processes
of the Soviet command economy without replacing them with efficiently
functioning markets. The initial reforms have featured greater authority
for enterprise managers over prices, wages, product mix, investment,
sources of supply, and customers. But in the absence of effective market
discipline, the result has been the disappearance of low-price goods,
excessive wage increases, an even larger volume of unfinished
construction projects, and, in general, continued economic stagnation.
The Gorbachev regime has made at least four serious errors in economic
policy in these six years: the unpopular and short-lived antialcohol
campaign; the initial cutback in imports of consumer goods; the failure
to act decisively at the beginning for the privatization of agriculture;
and the buildup of a massive overhang of unspent rubles in the hands of
households and enterprises. The regime has vacillated among a series of
ambitious economic policy prescriptions put forth by leading economists
and political leaders. The plans vary from proposals for (a) quick
marketization of the economy; (b) gradual marketization; (c) a period
of retrenchment to ensure a stable base for future marketization; and
(d) a return to disciplined central planning and allocation. The
economy, caught between two systems, is suffering from even greater
mismatches between what is being produced and what would serve the best
interests of enterprises and households. Meanwhile, the seething
nationality problems have been dislocating regional patterns of economic
specialization and pose a further major threat to growth prospects over
the next few years. Official Soviet statistics report GNP fell by 2% in
1990, but the actual decline was substantially greater. Whatever the
numerical decline, it does not capture the increasing disjointures in the
economy evidenced by emptier shelves, longer lines, increased barter, and
widespread strikes.


_#_GNP: approximately $2,660 billion, per capita $9,130;
real growth rate - 2.4% to - 5.0% (1990 est. based on a reconstruction
of official Soviet statistics); note--because of the continued
unraveling of Soviet economic and statistical controls, the estimate
is subject to even greater uncertainties than in earlier years; the
dollar estimates most likely overstate Soviet GNP to some extent because
of an incomplete allowance for the poor quality, narrow assortment, and
low performance characteristics of Soviet goods and services; the
- 2.4% growth figure is based on the application of CIA's usual
estimating methods whereas the - 5.0% figure is corrected for
measurement problems that worsened sharply in 1990


_#_Inflation rate (consumer prices): 14% (1990 est.)


_#_Unemployment rate: official Soviet statistics imply an unemployment
rate of 1 to 2 percent in 1990; USSR's first official unemployment
estimate, however, is acknowledged to be rough


_#_Budget: revenues 422 billion rubles; expenditures 510 billion
rubles, including capital expenditures of 53 billion rubles (1990 est.)


_#_Exports: $109.3 billion (f.o.b., 1989);

commodities--petroleum and petroleum products, natural gas, metals,
wood, agricultural products, and a wide variety of manufactured goods
(primarily capital goods and arms);

partners--Eastern Europe 46%, EC 16%, Cuba 6%, US, Afghanistan
(1989)


_#_Imports: $114.7 billion (c.i.f., 1989);

commodities--grain and other agricultural products, machinery and
equipment, steel products (including large-diameter pipe), consumer
manufactures;

partners--Eastern Europe 50%, EC 13%, Cuba, China, US (1989)


_#_External debt: $55 billion (1990)


_#_Industrial production: growth rate - 2.4% (1990 est.)


_#_Electricity: 350,000,000 kW capacity; 1,740,000 million kWh
produced, 5,920 kWh per capita (1990)


_#_Industries: diversified, highly developed capital goods and defense
industries; comparatively less developed consumer goods industries


_#_Agriculture: accounts for roughly 20% of GNP and labor force;
production based on large collective and state farms; inefficiently
managed; wide range of temperate crops and livestock produced; world's
third-largest grain producer after the US and China; shortages of grain,
oilseeds, and meat; world's leading producer of sawnwood and roundwood;
annual fish catch among the world's largest


_#_Illicit drugs: illegal producer of cannabis and opium poppy,
mostly for domestic consumption; government has begun eradication
program to control cultivation; used as a transshipment country
for illicit drugs to Western Europe


_#_Economic aid: donor--extended to non-Communist less developed
countries (1954-89), $49.6 billion; extended to other Communist countries
(1954-89), $154 billion


_#_Currency: ruble (plural--rubles); 1 ruble (R) = 100 kopeks


_#_Exchange rates: rubles (R) per US$1--0.580 (1990),
0.629 (1989), 0.629 (1988), 0.633 (1987), 0.704 (1986), 0.838 (1985);
note--as of 1 April 1991 the official exchange rate remained
administratively set; it should not be used indiscriminately to convert
domestic rubles to dollars; in November 1990 the USSR introduced a
commercial exchange rate of 1.8 rubles to the dollar used for accounting
purposes within the USSR and which was still in force on 1 April 1991;
on 1 April 1991 the USSR introduced a new foreign-currency
market for foreign companies and individuals; the rate will be fixed
twice a week based on supply and demand; as of 4 April 1991 the rate
was 27.6 rubles to the dollar; Soviet citizens traveling abroad
are restricted to buying $200 a year at prevailing rates

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: This Western capitalistic economy has done well since
Spain joined the EC in 1986. With annual increases in real GNP averaging
about 5% in the 1987-90 period, Spain has been the fastest growing member
of the EC. Increased investment--both domestic and foreign--has been the
most important factor pushing the economic expansion. Inflation moderated
to 4.8% in 1988, but an overheated economy caused inflation to reach
almost 7% in 1989-90. Another economic problem facing Spain is an
unemployment rate of 16.3%, the highest in Europe.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Sudan, one of the world's poorest countries, is buffeted
by civil war, chronic political instability, adverse weather, and
counterproductive economic policies. The economy is dominated
by governmental entities that account for more than 70% of new
investment. The private sector's main areas of activity are agriculture
and trading, with most private industrial investment predating 1980. The
economy's base is agriculture, which employs 80% of the work force.
Industry mainly processes agricultural items. Sluggish economic
performance over the past decade, attributable largely to declining
annual rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita income and
consumption. A high foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause
difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary Fund took the unusual
step of declaring Sudan noncooperative on account of its nonpayment of
arrearages to the Fund.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry, which
accounts for about 70% of export earnings and 40% of tax revenues. The
economy has been in trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in
1982. A drop in world bauxite prices that started in the late 1970s and
continued until late 1986, was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla
insurgency in the interior. The guerrillas targeted the economic
infrastructure, crippling the important bauxite sector and shutting down
other export industries. These problems have created high inflation,
high unemployment, widespread black market activity, and a bad climate
for foreign investment. A small gain in economic growth of 2.0% was
registered in 1989 due to reduced guerrilla activity and improved
international markets for bauxite.

equal rights to exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian
regulation. Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined
in the past, the only companies still mining are Norwegian and Soviet.
Each company mines about half a million tons of coal annually. The
settlements on Svalbard are essentially company towns. The Norwegian
state-owned coal company employs nearly 60% of the Norwegian population
on the island, runs many of the local services, and provides most of the
local infrastructure. There is also some trapping of seal, polar bear,
fox, and walrus.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which
occupies much of the labor force and contributes about 23% to GDP.
Manufacturing, which includes a number of agroprocessing factories,
accounts for another 26% of GDP. Mining has declined in importance in
recent years; high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted in 1978, and
health concerns cut world demand for asbestos. Exports of sugar and
forestry products are the main earners of hard currency. Surrounded by
South Africa, except for a short border with Mozambique, Swaziland
is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it receives 92% of
its imports and to which it sends about 40% of its exports.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during
World War I through World War II, Sweden has achieved an enviable
standard of living under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and
extensive welfare benefits. It has essentially full employment,
a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external
communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber, hydropower, and
iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is heavily
oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for
about 90% of industrial output, of which the engineering
sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. For some observers,
the Swedish model has succeeded in making economic efficiency
and social egalitarianism complementary, rather than competitive,
goals. Others argue that the Swedish model is on the verge of
collapsing by pointing to the serious economic problems Sweden
faces in 1991: high inflation and absenteeism, growing unemployment
and deficits, and declining international competitiveness. In 1990,
to improve the economy, the government approved a mandate for
Sweden to seek EC membership and an austerity and privatization
package and implemented a major tax reform. These reforms may
succeed in turning the economy around in 1992.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Switzerland's economic success is matched in few, if any,
other nations. Per capita output, general living standards, education
and science, health care, and diet are unsurpassed in Europe. Inflation
remains low because of sound government policy and harmonious
labor-management relations. Unemployment is negligible, a marked
contrast to the larger economies of Western Europe. This economic
stability helps promote the important banking and tourist sectors. Since
World War II, Switzerland's economy has adjusted smoothly to the great
changes in output and trade patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust
to the challenges of the 1990s, in particular, the further economic
integration of Western Europe and the amazingly rapid changes in East
European political/economic prospects.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Syria's rigidly structured Bathist economy turned
out slightly more goods in 1990 than in 1983, when the population was 20%
smaller. Economic difficulties are attributable, in part, to severe
drought in several recent years, costly but unsuccessful attempts
to match Israel's military strength, a falloff in Arab aid, and
insufficient foreign exchange earnings to buy needed inputs for industry
and agriculture. Socialist policy, embodied in a thicket of bureaucratic
regulations, in many instances has driven away or pushed underground the
mercantile and entrepreneurial spirit for which Syrian businessmen have
long been famous. Two bright spots: a sizable number of villagers have
benefited from land redistribution, electrification, and other rural
development programs; and a recent find of light crude oil has enabled
Syria to cut oil imports. A long-term concern is the additional drain of
upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when its vast dam and irrigation
projects are completed toward the end of the 1990s. Output in 1990
rebounded from the very bad year of 1989, as agricultural production
and oil revenues increased substantially.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world.
The economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about
47% of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force.
Industry accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing
agricultural products and light consumer goods. The economic
recovery program announced in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in
agricultural production and financial support for the program by
bilateral donors. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have
increased the availability of imports and provided funds to rehabilitate
Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Thailand, one of the more advanced developing countries
in Asia, enjoyed a year of 9% growth in 1990, although down from the
double-digit rates of 1987-89. The increasingly sophisticated
manufacturing sector benefited from export-oriented investment, but
the agricultural sector contracted 2%, primarily because of weaker
demand in Thailand's major overseas markets for commodities such as
rice. The trade deficit almost doubled in 1990, to $9 billion, but
earnings from tourism ($4.7 billion), remittances, and net capital
inflows helped keep the balance of payments in surplus. The government
has followed fairly sound fiscal and monetary policies, aided by
increased tax receipts from the fast-moving economy. In 1990 the
government approved new projects--especially for telecommunications
and roads--needed to refurbish the country's now overtaxed
infrastructure. Although growth in 1991 will slow further, Thailand's
economic outlook remains good, assuming the continuation of prudent
government policies in the wake of the 23 February 1991 military coup.

export earnings. Togo is self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when
harvests are normal. In the industrial sector phosphate mining is by
far the most important activity, with phosphate exports accounting for
about 40% of total foreign exchange earnings. Togo serves as a regional
commercial and trade center. The government actively encourages foreign
investment.

_#_Overview: Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum-based economy began to
emerge from a lengthy depression in 1990. The economy fell sharply
through most of the 1980s, largely because of the decline in oil prices.
This sector accounts for 80% of export earnings and more than 25% of
GDP. The government, in response to the oil revenue loss, pursued a
series of austerity measures that pushed the unemployment rate as high
as 22% in 1988. The economy showed signs of recovery in 1990, however,
helped along by rising oil prices. Agriculture employs only about 11% of
the labor force and produces about 3% of GDP. Since this sector is
small, it has been unable to absorb the large numbers of the unemployed.
The government currently seeks to diversify its export base.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy depends primarily on petroleum, phosphates,
tourism, and exports of light manufactures for continued growth.
Following two years of drought-induced economic decline, the economy
made a strong recovery in 1990 as a result of a bountiful harvest,
continued export growth, and higher domestic investment. Continued
high inflation and unemployment have eroded popular support for the
government, however, and forced Tunis to slow the pace of economic
reform. Nonetheless, the government appears committed to implementing
its IMF-supported structural adjustment program and to servicing
its foreign debt.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economic reforms that Turkey launched in 1980
continue to bring an impressive stream of benefits. The economy has grown
steadily since the early 1980s, with real growth in per capita GDP
increasing more than 6% annually. Agriculture remains the most important
economic sector, employing about 55% of the labor force, accounting for
almost 20% of GDP, and contributing about 20% to exports. Impressive
growth in recent years has not solved all of the economic problems facing
Turkey. Inflation and interest rates remain high, and a large budget
deficit will continue to provide difficulties for a country undergoing a
substantial transformation from a centrally controlled to a free market
economy. The government has launched a multimillion-dollar development
program in the southeastern region, which includes the building of a
dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to generate electric power
and irrigate large tracts of farmland. The planned tapping of huge
additional quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious concern in
the downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq.

activities. The islands are too small and too remote for development of
a tourist industry. Government revenues largely come from the sale of
stamps and coins and worker remittances. Substantial income is received
annually from an international trust fund established in 1987 by
Australia, New Zealand, and the UK and supported also by Japan and South
Korea.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Uganda has substantial natural resources, including
fertile soils, regular rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper
and cobalt. The economy has been devastated by much political
instability, mismanagement, and civil war since independence in 1962,
keeping Uganda poor with a per capita income of about $300. (GDP remains
below the levels of the early 1970s, as does industrial production.)
Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, employing over
80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export crop and accounts
for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government has
acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking
currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing
petroleum prices, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes
are especially aimed at dampening inflation, which was running at over
300% in 1987, and boosting production and export earnings.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's
highest incomes per capita outside the OECD nations. This wealth is based
on oil and gas, and the fortunes of the economy fluctuate with the prices
of those commodities. Since 1973, when petroleum prices shot up, the UAE
has undergone a profound transformation from an impoverished region of
small desert principalities to a modern state with a high standard of
living. At present levels of production, crude oil reserves should last
for over 100 years.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and
financial centers, and its economy ranks among the four largest in
Europe. The economy is essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture
of social welfare programs and government ownership. Over the last decade
the Thatcher government halted the expansion of welfare measures and
promoted extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector.
Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European
standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor
force. Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises, employing
about 27% of the work force and generating 22% of GDP. The UK is an
energy-rich nation with large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves;
primary energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest
shares of any industrial nation. In mid-1990 the economy fell into
recession after eight years of strong economic expansion, which had
raised national output by one quarter. Britain's inflation rate, which
has been consistently well above those of her major trading partners,
is expected to decline in 1991. Between 1986 and 1990 unemployment
fell from 11% to about 6%, but it is now rising rapidly because of
the economic slowdown. As a major trading nation, the UK will continue
to be greatly affected by world boom or recession, swings in the
international oil market, productivity trends in domestic industry,
and the terms on which the economic integration of Europe proceeds.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The US has the most powerful, diverse, and
technologically advanced economy in the world, with a per capita GNP
of $21,800, the largest among major industrial nations. In 1989 the
economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth, the
longest in peacetime history. The expansion featured moderation in
wage and consumer price increases and a steady reduction in
unemployment to 5.2% of the labor force. In 1990, however, growth
slowed to 1% because of a combination of factors, such as the
worldwide increase in interest rates, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and a general decline
in business and consumer confidence. Ongoing problems for the
1990s include inadequate investment in education and other economic
infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs, and sizable budget and
trade deficits.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy is slowly recovering from the deep recession
of the early 1980s. In 1988 real GDP grew by only 0.5% and in 1989 by
1.5%. The recovery was led by growth in the agriculture and fishing
sectors, agriculture alone contributing 20% to GDP, employing about 11%
of the labor force, and generating a large proportion of export earnings.
Raising livestock, particularly cattle and sheep, is the major
agricultural activity. In 1990, despite healthy exports and an improved
current account, domestic growth remained weak because of government
concentration on the external sector, adverse weather conditions, and
prolonged strikes. Bringing down high inflation, reducing a large fiscal
deficit, and avoiding frequent strikes remain major economic problems
for the government.

earnings in 1989. President Perez introduced an economic readjustment
program when he assumed office in February 1989. Lower tariffs and
price supports, a free market exchange rate, and market-linked interest
rates have thrown the economy into confusion, causing about an 8%
decline in GDP in 1989, but the economy recovered part way in 1990.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: This is a centrally planned, developing economy with
extensive government ownership and control of productive facilities.
The economy is primarily agricultural; the sector employs about 65% of
the labor force and accounts for almost half of GNP. Rice is the staple
crop; substantial amounts of maize, sorghum, cassava, and sweet potatoes
are also grown. The government permits sale of surplus grain on the open
market. Most of the mineral resources are located in the north,
including coal, which is an important export item. Oil was discovered
off the southern coast in 1986 with production reaching 54,000 b/d in
1990 and expected to increase in the years ahead. Following the
end of the war in 1975, heavy-handed government measures undermined
efforts at an efficient merger of the agricultural resources of the
south and the industrial resources of the north. The economy remains
heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received assistance from
Communist countries, Sweden, and UN agencies. Inflation, although down
from recent triple-digit levels, is still a major weakness and is
showing signs of accelerating upwards again. Per capita output is among
the world's lowest. Since late 1986 the government has sponsored a
broad reform program that seeks to turn more economic activity over to
the private sector.

_#_Overview: The economy is limited to traditional subsistence
agriculture, with about 80% of the labor force earning its livelihood
from agriculture (coconuts and vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs),

Revenues come from French Government subsidies, licensing of fishing
rights to Japan and South Korea, import taxes, and remittances from
expatriate workers in New Caledonia. Wallis and Futuna imports food,
fuel, clothing, machinery, and transport equipment, but its exports
are negligible, consisting of copra and handicrafts.

_@_West Bank
_#_Note: The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended
with Israel in control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai,
and the Golan Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and
reaffirmed by President Reagan's 1 September 1982 peace initiative, the
final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with
their neighbors, and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be
negotiated among the concerned parties. Camp David further specifies
that these negotiations will resolve the respective boundaries. Pending
the completion of this process, it is US policy that the final status of
the West Bank and the Gaza Strip has yet to be determined. In the view
of the US, the term West Bank describes all of the area west of the
Jordan River under Jordanian administration before the 1967
Arab-Israeli war. However, with respect to negotiations envisaged in the
framework agreement, it is US policy that a distinction must be made
between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's
special status and circumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for
the final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that
of the rest of the West Bank.

is to be governed.


_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by
Israeli military occupation and the effects of the Palestinian uprising.
Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable financial
resources have been discouraged by a lack of financial resources and
Israeli policy. Capital investment has largely gone into residential
housing, not into productive assets that could compete with Israeli
industry. A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers
employed in Israel and neighboring Gulf states but remittances from the
Gulf dropped dramatically in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in
August 1990. Israeli reprisals against Palestinian unrest in the West
Bank since 1987 have pushed unemployment up and lowered living standards.
The Persian Gulf crisis of 1990-91 also dealt a blow to the economy.
Many Palestinians returned from the Gulf, exacerbating unemployment.
Export revenues have plunged because of the loss of export markets in
Jordan and the Gulf.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: In 1990 the world economy grew at an estimated 1.0%,
considerably lower than the estimated 3.0% for 1989 and the 3.4% for
1988. The technologically advanced areas--North America, Japan, and
Western Europe--together account for 67% of the gross world product (GWP)
of $20.9 trillion; these developed areas grew in the aggregate at 2.3%
in 1990. In contrast, output in the USSR and Eastern Europe fell an
average of 5.2%; these countries account for 15% of GWP. Experience
in the developing countries continued mixed, with the newly
industrializing economies generally maintaining their rapid growth,
and many others struggling with debt, rampant inflation, and inadequate
investment. This third group contributed 18% of GWP and grew on
average 2.3% in 1990; output in this group is probably understated
because of lack of data and the method of calculation used. The year 1990
witnessed continued political and economic upheavals in the USSR and
Eastern Europe, which are in between systems, lacking both the rough
discipline of the command economy and the institutions of the market
economy. As for prospects in the 1990s, the addition of nearly 100
million people a year to an already overcrowded globe will exacerbate the
problems of pollution, desertification, underemployment, epidemics,
and famine.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political
capital of a united Yemen, the southern city Aden, with its refinery
and port facilities, is the economic and commercial capital. Future
economic development depends heavily on Western-assisted development
of promising oil resources. South Yemen's willingness to merge stemmed
partly from the steady decline in Soviet economic support.

North--The low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made
northern Yemen dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential
needs. Large trade deficits have been made up for by remittances from
Yemenis working abroad and foreign aid. Once self-sufficient in food
production, northern Yemen has been a major importer. Land once used for
export crops--cotton, fruit, and vegetables--has been turned over to
growing qat, a mildly narcotic shrub chewed by Yemenis that has no
significant export market. Oil export revenues started flowing in late
1987 and boosted 1988 earnings by about $800 million.

South--This has been one of the poorest Arab countries, with a per
capita GNP of about $500. A shortage of natural resources, a widely
dispersed population, and an arid climate have made economic development
difficult. The economy has grown at an average annual rate of only 2-3%
since the mid-1970s. The economy had been organized along socialist
lines, dominated by the public sector. Economic growth has been
constrained by a lack of incentives, partly stemming from centralized
control over production decisions, investment allocation, and import
choices.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: For 20 years Communist Yugoslavia had been trying to
replace the Stalinist command economy with a decentralized semimarket
system that features worker self-management councils in all large plants.
This hybrid system neared collapse in late 1989 when inflation soared.
The government applied shock therapy in 1990 under an IMF standby
program that provides tight control over monetary expansion, a freeze
on wages, the pegging of the dinar to the deutsche mark, and a partial
price freeze on energy, transportation, and communal services. This
program brought hyperinflation to a halt and encouraged a rise in
foreign investment. Since June 1990, however, inflation has
rebounded and threatens to rise further in 1991. Estimated annual
inflation for 1990 is 164%. Other huge problems remain: rising
unemployment, the low quality of industrial output, and striking
differences in income between the poorer southern regions and the
comparatively well-off northern areas. Even so, political issues far
outweigh economic problems in importance.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: In 1990, in spite of large mineral resources and one
of the most developed and diversified economies in Sub-Saharan Africa,
Zaire had a GDP per capita of only about $200, one of the lowest on the
continent. The country's chronic economic problems worsened in 1990,
with copper production down 20% to a 20-year low, inflation near
250% compared with 100% in 1987-89, and IMF and most World Bank support
suspended until the institution of agreed-on changes. Agriculture, a key
sector of the economy, employs 75% of the population but generates
under 25% of GDP. The main potential for economic development has been
the extractive industries. Mining and mineral processing account for
about one-third of GDP and two-thirds of total export earnings.
Zaire is the world's largest producer of diamonds.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: The economy has been in decline for more than a decade
with falling imports and growing foreign debt. Economic difficulties
stem from a sustained drop in copper production and ineffective economic
policies. In 1990 real GDP stood only slightly higher than that of 10
years before, while an annual population growth of more than 3% has
brought a decline in per capita GDP of 25% during the same period. A
high inflation rate has also added to Zambia's economic woes in recent
years.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Agriculture employs three-fourths of the labor force and
supplies almost 40% of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on
agriculture and mining, produces a variety of goods and contributes 35%
to GDP. Mining accounts for only 5% of both GDP and employment, but
supplies of minerals and metals account for about 40% of exports. Wide
year-to-year fluctuations in agricultural production over the past six
years have resulted in an uneven growth rate, one that on average matched
the 3% annual increase in population.

_*_Economy
_#_Overview: Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with considerable
government guidance of investment and foreign trade and partial
government ownership of some large banks and industrial firms. Real
growth in GNP has averaged about 9% a year during the past three decades.
Export growth has been even faster and has provided the impetus for
industrialization. Agriculture contributes about 4% to GNP, down from 35%
in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13 among major trading
countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily being
replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive industries.

Metric Interrelationships

Conversions from a multiple or submultiple to the basic units of meters,
liters, or grams can be done using the table.  For example, to convert
from kilometers to meters, multiply by 1,000 (9.26 kilometers equals
9,260 meters) or to convert from meters to kilometers, multiply by 0.001
(9,260 meters equals 9.26 kilometers)

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
