            CONSTITUTION OF THE EMPIRE OF JAPAN, 1889


Imperial Oath Sworn in the Sanctuary in the Imperial Palace
(Tsuge-bumi)

     We, the Successor to the prosperous Throne of Our
Predecessors, do humbly and solemnly swear to the Imperial
Founder of Our House and to Our other Imperial Ancestors that, in
pursuance of a great policy co-extensive with the Heavens and
with the Earth, We shall maintain and secure from decline the
ancient form of government.

     In consideration of the progressive tendency of the course
of human affairs and in parallel with the advance of
civilization, We deem it expedient, in order to give clearness
and distinctness to the instructions bequeathed by the Imperial
Founder of Our House and by Our other Imperial Ancestors, to
establish fundamental laws formulated into express provisions of
law, so that, on the one hand, Our Imperial posterity may possess
an express guide for the course they are to follow, and that, on
the other, Our subjects shall thereby be enabled to enjoy a wider
range of action in giving Us their support, and that the
observance of Our laws shall continue to the remotest ages of
time. We will thereby to give greater firmness to the stability
of Our country and to promote the welfare of all the people
within the boundaries of Our dominions; and We now establish the
Imperial House Law and the Constitution. These Laws come to only
an exposition of grand precepts for the conduct of the
government, bequeathed by the Imperial Founder of Our House and
by Our other Imperial Ancestors. That we have been so fortunate
in Our reign, in keeping with the tendency of the times, as to
accomplish this work, We owe to the glorious Spirits of the
Imperial Founder of Our House and of Our other Imperial Ancestors.

     We now reverently make Our prayer to Them and to Our
Illustrious Father, and implore the help of Their Sacred Spirits,
and make to Them solemn oath never at this time nor in the future
to fail to be an example to our subjects in the observance of the
Laws hereby established.

     May the heavenly Spirits witness this Our solemn Oath.



    Imperial Rescript on the Promulgation of the Constitution

     Whereas We make it the joy and glory of Our heart to behold
the prosperity of Our country, and the welfare of Our subjects,
We do hereby, in virtue of the Supreme power We inherit from Our
Imperial Ancestors, promulgate the present immutable fundamental
law, for the sake of Our present subjects and their descendants.

     The Imperial Founder of Our House and Our other Imperial
ancestors, by the help and support of the forefathers of Our
subjects, laid the foundation of Our Empire upon a basis, which
is to last forever. That this brilliant achievement embellishes
the annals of Our country, is due to the glorious virtues of Our
Sacred Imperial ancestors, and to the loyalty and bravery of Our
subjects, their love of their country and their public spirit.
Considering that Our subjects are the descendants of the loyal
and good subjects of Our Imperial Ancestors, We doubt not but
that Our subjects will be guided by Our views, and will
sympathize with all Our endeavors, and that, harmoniously
cooperating together, they will share with Us Our hope of making
manifest the glory of Our country, both at home and abroad, and
of securing forever the stability of the work bequeathed to Us by
Our Imperial Ancestors.



                   Preamble [or Edict] (Joyu)

     Having, by virtue of the glories of Our Ancestors, ascended
the throne of a lineal succession unbroken for ages eternal;
desiring to promote the welfare of, and to give development to
the moral and intellectual faculties of Our beloved subjects, the
very same that have been favored with the benevolent care and
affectionate vigilance of Our Ancestors; and hoping to maintain
the prosperity of the State, in concert with Our people and with
their support, We hereby promulgate, in pursuance of Our Imperial
Rescript of the 12th day of the 10th month of the 14th year of
Meiji, a fundamental law of the State, to exhibit the principles,
by which We are guided in Our conduct, and to point out to what
Our descendants and Our subjects and their descendants are
forever to conform.

     The right of sovereignty of the State, We have inherited
from Our Ancestors, and We shall bequeath them to Our
descendants. Neither We nor they shall in the future fail to

rights and of the property of Our people, and to secure to them
the complete enjoyment of the same, within the extent of the
provisions of the present Constitution and of the law.

Constitution, and in no otherwise shall Our descendants or Our
subjects be permitted to attempt any alteration thereof.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
