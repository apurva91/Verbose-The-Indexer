WHILE IT APPEARS THAT COMPUTERS ARE AN INCREDIBLE DEAL
THEY ARE REALLY TWICE AS GOOD A DEAL AS IT SEEMS TO BE


COMPUTERS INCREASED IN VALUE TWICE AS MUCH AS IT APPEARS
SINCE THE FIRST CONSUMER HARD DRIVES BECAME AVAILABLE IN
APPROXIMATELY 1979


WHERE DOES OUR MONEY GO?


Many of you are aware that the $3,000 you spent on computers
last year could be replaced by $2,000 spent today.  However,
only recently have I actually purchased computer gear that I
bought with dollars that were only half as valuable as those
with which one of my drives was purchased in 1979.

Many of you are aware that the average personal computer was
$5,000 - $10,000 some 10 - 15 years ago when Apples and IBMs
first appeared on the scene, but you might not be aware of a
trend beyond the price reduction that makes today's computer
prices an even better bargain in comparison.

In fact, computers today are TWICE as good a bargain as they
appear in comparisons with those early computers, and it was
already looking as if they were bargains beyond all belief.

In earlier articles I mentioned the fact that today's cheapy
486 DX2/66 computers were 100 times as fast as the originals
from IBM, and were likely to also have 100 time as much hard
drive storage.  [After all, the original PC didn't even have
hard drives, and still cost a fortune.]

Here are a few examples to jog your memory:

These are "bare bones" prices for the computer systems; when
filled out with color monitors, printers, ports, modems, and
the rest of an average computer system, these prices usually
doubled, and the prices I usually quote as modern comparison
figures include VGA, printer, modem, mouse, and software.

1979 Konan 5M External Hard Drive Kit for Apples      $3,000
1981 PC-DOS CP/M 1-Floppy 128K-RAM serial-parallel    $2,000
1983 PC-XT added 3 slots and 10M hard drive           $3,600
1983 PC to XT Upgrade kit with 5M ST-506 Hard Drive   $1,500
1984 PC-AT 1.2M Floppy 256K-RAM no ports 3x faster    $4,000
1984 PC-AT Enhanced  added 20M hard drive   no ports  $5,800

[These two Hard Drive Kits both included the ST-506 drives--
but the Apple was External while the IBM was Internal:  both
were from third-party vendors.]


Back in those days extra floppy drives from Apple or IBM for
around $325 to $475 respectively [and don't forget that many
of these floppies were single sided and held around 150K but
we only tend to remember the double sided floppies.  If your
memory includes "flippies" you know what I mean.  (Flippies:
single sided floppy disks which were notched so you could do
a "flip-over" with the floppy, and use the other side, which
was supposed to be unusable but which in most cases was just
as good as the side you actually paid for.  Don't forget the
floppy disks started at $10 each, with dollars that were the
equivalent of $2 in 1993 dollars:  so, each time you punched
a notch and turned one over, you basically gained $20 in the
money we use today.  You then also needed only half as much,
in terms of physical shelf space, to store as much data.  It
might stagger the present day mind to actually think of that
monstrous storage problem we had when we wanted to store any
huge books, such as the Bible, on single sided floppies.

The two points I want to make here are that for the cheapest
of these machine prices back then, you can now get a machine
that is 100 times faster with 100 times the disk space:  and
that the same is true for the most expensive AND that prices
today are actually half what they appear to be in comparison
to the prices listed above.

So, when you spend $3,000 on computer gear today, you are in
fact only spending half as much as was spent back in '79 for
the Konan drive. . .you are really only spending $1,500 from
1979. . .due to changes in the value of the dollar as per an
assortment of Consumer Price Index figures [none of which is
in agreement with any of the others, so you are encouraged a
bit to look up additional information on the subject.  These
figures [below] are presented only to provide a continuum to
make comparisons.  Actually these figures are a conservative
estimate [as most government figures seem to be [example, no
double digit inflation for any year since 1947, which was an
extremely good year, by the way.]

So, while other prices were rising to make up for weakenings
in the dollar. . .you are probably aware that your expenses,
in general, have just about exactly doubled since 1979, when
we bought that first hard drive for $3,000.  Those $3,000 in
a bank account that created no real profit other than enough
interest to keep up with the Cost of Living increases, would
now be $6,000 and would buy you a computer more powerful and
with more RAM and hard drive space than most of you want.  A
Pentium with 8 megabytes of RAM and adding several gigabytes
of hard drive, or a 486 with even more RAM and hard drive.

While the prices of everything else had been going up at 5%,
6%, 7%, 8%, 9% a year, the price of computers has gone down,
at about 33% per year. . .a truly astonishing rate that lets
you buy something hundreds of times better for less than the
price was just 10 or 15 years ago.

Below you will find a short index of the computers we bought
since 1979, and then a price index from 1875 to 2010 in case
you want to look up some prices mentioned in certain years a
decade or a century ago would actually be today.

For example, a teenager watching Roger Rabbit mentioned that
the $100 Bob Hoskins received for working on the case was an
extremely low figure.  However, an examination of the figure
below for 1947 will reveal that prices then were about 17.5%
which would make Hoskins' fee about $600 in our 1993 dollars
we use today. . .even if the physical dollars are the same.

So, what happens to the value that was lost from our dollars
that do not buy as much by a factor of 17.5% since 1947 ?

Let's imagine for a moment that we are financial wizards and
have all the financial connections open to such wizards; the
early 1970's are a perfect example:  Nixon is in office, and
he releases the dollar from the $35 per ounce price supports
the dollar has had since Roosevelt took us off the standards
of direct gold exchange to end the Depression in the 1930's.

As an example, we send a million of our dollars to somewhere
we CAN buy gold [it was illegal then for US citizens to have
gold, unless they were coin collectors or worked gold in the
professions, such as dentistry, jewelry, etc.]

So, we have bought a million dollars worth of gold at around
$35 per ounce, which was a pretty fixed price at the time.

Now, the price restrictions of $35 per ounce are removed and
the price of gold goes up to $755 per ounce, just about what
it did during the next few months after the price release.

Now our gold is worth 21 times as many dollars as it was, so
we now can sell the gold and get 21 million dollars.

When we spend this 21 million dollars, we are competing with
all the other dollars in the marketplace, and prices have to
go up as a result, because there are now more dollars but no
more anything else. . .so dollars get cheap, and all dollars
everywhere give up a percentage of their value to pay for an
increase in the number of dollars WE have.  So, if all these
dollars lose 5% of their value, then we can buy a 20 million
dollar share of the future with our 21 million dollars while
everyone else loses 5% of the money they let sit in pockets,
under the mattress, or wherever.

Half of the value of every dollar disappeared from 1979-1993
[a period in which the Cost/Price Indexes rose at about 6%].

And those 1979 dollars would buy only half as much as a 1969
dollar bought, when prices were rising even more quickly.

And those 1969 dollars were buying only half of what dollars
bought in 1947.

Here are the doubling years:

2010
1993
1979
1969
1947
1916 and 1933 had similar costs, about half those of 1947;
     these fluctuations were caused by WW I and Depression
1898 was also a very low point, but prices before this had
     been quite stable by today's standards, with 1989 and
     1899 being the only two exceptions: which happened to
     cancel each other out fairly well

Thus, approximately, prices in 2010 will be double what is
the case in 1993, just as 1993 was double 1979; 1979 which
was double 1969, which was double 1947, which was double a
spread around WW I and the Depression.

With 1993 labeled as "1.00000" the value of a dollar which
is expected to be spent in 2010 will be "0.50000" or fifty
cents.

2010 $1 buys $0.50 worth of 1993 dollars
1993 $1 buys $1.00 worth of 1993 dollars
1979 $1 buys $2.00 worth of 1993 dollars
1969 $1 buys $4.00 worth of 1993 dollars
1947 $1 buys $8.00 worth of 1993 dollars
1916 and 1933 $1 buys $16.00 worth of 1993 dollars
1898 $1 buys $32.00 worth of 1993 dollars

[These are obviously gross approximations:
more exact figures are presented below.]

Here are some less conservative estimates, from other sources:

Based on an estimated 17% increase from 1989 to 1993 [4%/year]

Prices doubled as follows:

1982 to 1993
1973 to 1982
1950 to 1973



1993    1.17xxxx
1978    0.573016
1968    0.299207
1946    0.153972

Note fluctuations for WWI, WWII, and Depression:
these come close to these doublings, but not for
a permanent trend.

1916    0.090478
1915    0.075394


1898    0.047620   Was the lowest trend:

which provides for the widest possible span of
1993    1.17xxxx
     to
1898    0.047620

with prices being some 25 times higher in 1993 than 1898,
for price increase of 2400% over those 95 years.


THE PROJECT GUTENBERG PRICE INDEX FROM 1875 TO 1989
[With estimates up to and including 2010.]

This part contains a short chart of all the prices paid by the
Project Gutenberg supporters for drives from 1971 to 1993, and
then charts of the Consumer Price Indexes from 1875 to 1989.

The Project Gutenberg Drive Price Chart is about one page long
and is followed by a series of charts for each year from 1875-
1989, with a few additional estimates for 1990-1993.

Many of you have seen the figures I have presented as evidence
of the fact that current trends lead to HOLDING THE LIBRARY OF
CONGRESS IN THE PALM OF YOUR HAND WITHIN THE AVERAGE LIFETIME.
[Of course if they will let you HAVE the Library of Congress].

These figures range from the first 5 megabyte hard drives used
in our very first mainframe, through the first 5M Apple drive,
to the same drive running on an IBM, to our current 1.2G drive
that cost less than ANY of our previous drives and has storage
for twice as much data.

Of course, since I used only the real prices we paid for drive
after drive, it was only a matter of time until the cost/price
index would begin to play an important role, and we now have a
database of drive prices long enough that the $3,000 price for
the Konan 5M External ST506 Apple Hard Drive Kit in 1979 was a
mere half of what it would be in today's 1993 dollars.  Thus:

The first 5 1/4 hard drive we got [Seagate-ST506] should be at
$6,000 in today's pricing index, or, conversely, we should see
that the $850 we paid for a Toshiba 1.2G drive is really only:

$425 per 1200 megabytes. . .in 1979 dollars.


The Database of Project Gutenberg Drive Costs:

1971 $50,000 per  5M at $10,000     for the removable 5M drive chassis
                                    each 5M added was about $1500
1979 $3000 per    5M at $600/M      [Same ST506 drive as I got in 1983, but
1980                                set up as external drive for the Apple]
1981 Prices unstable early on
1982

Prices VERY stable now, falling by about 1/3 per year.

1983 $1500 per    5M at $300/M      (Please see footnotes directly below)*
1984 $1950 per   10M at $195/M      (only Seagate drive in 1985 Blue Book)*
1985 $1500 per   20M at $75/M       (some disagreement about the year here)
1986 $1500 per   40M at $37.50/M
1986 $1595 per   80M at $20/M  -->  (IBM listed in Blue Book as 1984 price)
1987 $1500 per   80M at $19/M       (but I never saw until two years later)
1988 $1500 per  120M at $12.50/M
1989 $1500 per  200M at $7.50/M
1990 $1500 per  300M at $5/M
1992 $1000 per 1000M at $1/M    [In Summer 1993 we got a Toshiba 1200 Meg]
1993  $666 per 1000M at $.67/M  [Actual cost was $.71/M at $850 per 1200M]
1994  $444 per 1000M at $.44/M  [IBM in 1993 was $.50/M @ $4000 per 8000M]
1994  $296 per 1000M at $.30/M
1995  $198 per 1000M at $.20/M
1996  $132 per 1000M at $.13/M
1997   $88 per 1000M at $.08/M
1998   $58 per 1000M at $.06/M
1999   $39 per 1000M at $.04/M
2000   $26 per 1000M at $.03/M
2001   $17 per 1000M at $.02/M
2002   $12 per 1000M at $.01/M

Disclaimer:  most of these are personal recollections,
but are close to estimates I have looked up, as below.
[How is it that 1985 and 1990 can seem so LONG ago!?!]

*Suggested resale price was $771 in 1983, still over $150/M
*(by the 1987 edition, resale price was $89, only $9/M)
*Shugart and Tandon were not listed
*IBM DID list a 20M for $1595, only $80/M, couldn't find one
*IBM listed 360K floppies at $425 and 1.2M floppies at $650
*floppies dropping at 33%/yr are now under $100, of course,
*IBM 512K RAM cards were $1125, 256K RAM cards were $295
*IBM 128K RAM cards were $350



THE PROJECT GUTENBERG PRICE INDEX FROM 1875 TO 2010

How to use the chart, first set of examples:

The price in current 1993 dollars for any year is found in
the first column.  Thus you can see that a one dollar item
from 1993 will cost about $1.95 in 2010.

The value of the dollars used in any particular year would
be found in the second column [value compared to 1993].  A
dollar in 2010 will be worth about $.51 1993 dollars while
a dollar from 1978-9 would be worth about $2.00 now.


THE PROJECT GUTENBERG PRICE INDEX FROM 1875 TO 2010

How to use the chart, second set of examples:

To remind you that these figures are presented ONLY as an indicator
and not as anything approaching reality, here are an additional set
of examples from a different report, for several sample years.  You
can easily see [where we have integrated them below in the 1989 set
of figures] that not only are the adjustments sometimes quite high,
but that figures from different reports aren't always even remotely
close to each other.

As an example, while working on these figures I noticed a lack of a
period of "double digit inflation" commonly referred to in most all
recent reports on these economic trends.  I checked this with local
sources in the field, and was given the following figures which did
include [just barely] some "double digit inflation", but only for a
few years of the 70's and early 80's.

In short, continue to beware of statistics, and please be advised a
bit that while these figures MAY have a certain consistency, within
the columns, that there relation to reality is probably far from an
intensely accurate reflection of real prices over the century.

THE PROJECT GUTENBERG PRICE INDEX FROM 1875 TO 2010

How to use the chart, third set of examples:

This index will allow you to estimate the cost of any item
in the dollars of any year included in the index.


Example:  You know the cost of an item in 1900 was $1, and
you want to know the cost it would have had in 1989 dollar
figures [i.e. "adjusting for inflation"].

First go to the base year of 1900, in which 1.000000 is an
estimated base for the year 1900.

Then look for the 1989 figure in the 1900 table:

1989   18.000607    0.055554

This indicates that the item costing $1 in 1900 would cost
approximately $18 in 1989.

The second column is the inverse function, meaning an item
costing $1 in 1989 would have cost about $.05 or $.06 back
in the year 1900.


You should be able to find some interesting trends such as
that prices were falling back in 1875 as industrial growth
swept the United States and the West was being developed.


[Based on an item costing $67 in 1875 {$1,000 in 1989}]

Prices fell from $67 to $47 from 1875 to 1898, in a rather
steady progression, and then rather steadily rose back for
the next two decades until World War I, until they reached
$67 again in 1913 and $69 in 1914, which were the last two
years of moderate inflation until after 1919, when pricing
dropped from a high of $139 after doubling since 1914.

Prices stabilized during the rest of the 1920's about $110
until 1930, and the Great Depression, in which prices fell
to $88 in 1933 and then back to the ranges of the 1920's--
until around the end of World War II, when prices went out
of control, rising from an average of around $120 for WWII
on the whole to $200 in 1951.  It took 17 years to hit the
$300 level in 1968 and 22 years to double to $400 in 1973.

From 1973 it took only 9 years to double again to $800 for
the year 1982.

[At 7% per year, it takes 10 years for inflation to cut $1
to $.05, at 1% it takes 70 years, at 3% it is 23 years and
at 4% it takes about 18 years].  Based on 4% inflation, it
will be

1990    1.040000   [based on 1989 as 1.000000 base year]
1991  1.081600   [and based on 4.0000% inflation rate]
1992  1.124864
1993  1.169856

which would be an 11 year span for prices to double, since
they were at 0.793652 in 1982 to 1.169856, projected 1993]


Below are files for every year on this chart independently listed
with that year as the base year, so you can look up for instance,
what something from 1930 would have cost in 1950, or the reverse.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
