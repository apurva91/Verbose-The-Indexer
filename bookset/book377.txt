KANSAS WOMEN IN LITERATURE

By Nettie Garmer Barker



          TO MY NEAREST AND DEAREST--
          MY SILENT PARTNERS--
          MY HUSBAND AND MY MOTHER.





KANSAS WOMEN IN LITERATURE.

     "We are proud of Kansas, the beautiful queen,
        And proud are we of her fields of corn;
     But a nobler pride than these I ween,
        Is our pride in her children, Kansas born!"

     --Ellen P. Allerton--


     --Or adopted. In this galaxy of bright
     women, the State has a noble pride for every
     name, be its owner Kansas born or adopted,
     is a mightier force for good than its "walls of corn."





EFFIE GRAHAM.


The last place one would expect to find romance is in arithmetic and
yet--Miss Effie Graham, the head of the Department of Mathematics in the
Topeka High School, has found it there and better still, in her lecture
"Living Arithmetic" she has shown others the way to find it there. Miss
Graham is one of the most talented women of the state. Ex-Gov. Hoch
has called her "one of the most gifted women in the state noted for its
brilliant women. Her heart and life are as pure as her mind is bright."

She was born and reared in Ohio, the daughter of a family of Ohio
pioneers, a descendant of a Revolutionary soldier and also, of a warrior
of 1812. As a student of the Ohio Northern University and later as
a post-graduate worker at the University of California, Chicago
University, and Harvard Summer School, she has as she says, "graduated
sometimes and has a degree but never 'finished' her education."

Desiring to get the school out into the world as well as the world back
to the school, she has spoken and written on "Moving Into The King Row,"
"Other Peoples' Children," "Spirit of the Younger Generation," "Vine
Versus Oak," and "The Larger Service."

"Pictures Eight Hundred Children Selected," "Speaking of Automobiles,"
"The Unusual Thing," "The High Cost of Learning," and "Wanted--A Funeral
of Algebraic Phraseology;" also, some verse, "The Twentieth Regiment
Knight" and "Back to God's Country" are magazine work that never came
back. School Science & Mathematics, a magazine to which she contributes
and of which she is an associate editor, gives hers as the only woman's
name on its staff of fifty editors.

Her book, "The Passin' On Party," raises the author to the rank of a
classic. To quote a critic: it is "a little like 'Mrs. Wiggs of the
Cabbage Patch,' a little like 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' but not just like
either of them. She reaches right down into human breasts and grips the
heart strings."

It is the busy people who find time to do things and the mother-heart of
Miss Graham finds expression in her household in West Lawn, a suburb
of Topeka. Among the members of her family are a niece and nephew whose
High School and College education she directs.




ESTHER M. CLARK.


Every Kansan, homesick in a foreign land, knows the call of Kansas and
every Kansan book lover knows Esther Clark's "Call of Kansas."

     "Sweeter to me than the salt sea spray,
       the fragrance of summer rains:
     Nearer my heart than these mighty hills
       are the wind-swept Kansas plains:
     Dearer the sight of a shy, wild rose by the
       roadside's dusty way
     Than all the splendor of poppy-fields
       ablaze in the sun of May.

     Gay as the bold poinsetta is,
       and the burden of pepper trees,
     The sunflower, tawny and gold and brown,
       is richer, to me, than these.
     And rising ever above the song
       of the hoarse, insistent sea,
     The voice of the prairie,
       calling, calling me.


Miss Clark was born in Neosho Co., Kansas, about twelve miles southeast
of Chanute, on a farm. At seven years of age, the family moved to
Chanute and her school days were spent at the old Pioneer Building,
where her mother went to school before her. In 1894, she graduated here,
later entering the University of Kansas for work in English.

In 1906, "Verses by a Commonplace Person" was published. "The Call of
Kansas and Other Verse" came out in 1909. This volume contained "My
Dear" and "Good Night" which were set to music, and "Rose O' My Heart."

     "Rose o' my heart, to-day I send
       A rose or two,
     You love roses, Rose o' my heart,
       I love you.

     Rose o' my heart, a rose is sweet
       And fresh as dew.
     Some have thorns, but, Rose o' my heart,
       None have you.

     Rose o' my heart, this day wear
       My roses, do!
     For next to my heart, Rose o' my heart,
       I wear you."


"My Dear" was written for her baby brother, during an absence from home,
and is Miss Clark's favorite.

She is in the office of the Extension Department at the University of
Kansas, and has exclusive charge of club programs and does some work in
package libraries.

Just now she is contributing prose to some of the newspapers and doing
some splendid feature work.




MARY VANCE HUMPHREY.


Mary Vance Humphrey of Junction City, Kansas, has written a series of
short stories on the property rights of women in Kansas, a subject that
was and is, still, of vital importance to the women of the state. "The
Legal Status of Mrs. O'Rourke" and "King Lear in Kansas" are two of the
series.

When young in heart and experience, Mrs. Humphrey wrote a number of
poems. Her work in later years has been only prose. Her novel, "The
Squatter Sovereign" is an historical romance of pioneer days, the
settlement of Kansas in the fifties.

Mrs. Humphrey is one of the founders of the Kansas State Social Science
Club and the Woman's Kansas Day Club and the founder of the Reading Club
of Junction City. She has served as President of the State Federation
and as Director of the General Federation of Women's Clubs and President
of the Woman's Kansas Day Club. Her work as member of the Board of
Education has done much for Junction City and her interest in libraries
has done equally as much for the State of Kansas.

Of her record as an official, Margaret Hill McCarter has written: "Her
whole soul is in her work. She is the genuine metal, shirking nothing,
cheapening nothing, and withal happy in the enjoyment of her obligation.
She stands for patriotism, progress and peace. Something of the message
of the shepherds heard out beyond Bethlehem that Christmas morning long
ago sounds in the chords she strikes."

As the wife of the late Judge James Humphrey, she proved herself the
able companion of such a worthy man.




KATE A. APLINGTON.


The Kansas State Traveling Art Gallery owes its birth and much of its
success to Kate A. Aplington, the author of that typical western story,
"Pilgrims of the Plains." Since Feb., 1907, the Art Gallery has been
a recognized state institution, and as its Vice-President and
Superintendent and as the writer of the art lectures that accompany the
work, Mrs. Aplington's broad-minded, artistic temperament and student's
persistency have made the gallery truly a work of art.

At present, the Aplingtons are living at Miami, Florida, but for a
quarter of a century, Council Grove, the most famous spot on the Santa
Fe Trail, was their home. Special investigations and researches on the
subject of the old Santa Fe Trail days and lecturers on educational and
literary topics resulted from years spent in that historic place.

"Pilgrims of the Plains," which came out in Feb., 1913, is worthy of
a place in the front rank of western stories. In July of this year,
Grossett and Dunlap will bring it out in their "Popular Edition" of
novels.

Mrs. Aplington is now working on a book on "Art-Museums of America" and
judging from the comments of prominent Museum Directors, this will be as
great a success as her novel. "Florida of the Reclamation," a character
story with scenes laid in and around Miami, Florida, is also in
preparation.




EMMA UPTON VAUGHN.


The author of that versatile little book of short stories, "The Lower
Bureau Drawer" is Emma Upton Vaughn, a Kansas City, Kansas teacher.
These heart stories, showing keen insight of human nature--especially
woman nature--deal with every day life, each one a fascinating
revelation, of character and soul.

Mrs. Vaughn was born in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Her early life was spent
in Kansas. She is a graduate of the Kansas University, and has taught in
the public schools of the state.

She wrote the "Bible and the Flag in the Public Schools" and has
contributed both prose and verse to the leading magazines and
newspapers. Feature articles and many good essays appear over her
signature. Her "Passing From Under The Partial Eclipse" did much to
give Kansas City, Kansas her recognized place commercially on the map.
A novel, "The Cresap Pension," exposing a great pension fraud, is ready
for the press.




JESSIE WRIGHT WHITECOMB.


Jessie Wright Whitcomb, a Topeka writer of juvenile books is a lawyer in
active practice with her husband, Judge George H. Whitcomb and a mother
of a remarkable family of five boys and one girl. The oldest son gained
his A. B. in 1910 at the age of eighteen; in 1911 was appointed Rhodes
scholar for Kansas; and is now a student at Oxford. His father and
mother are in England at present visiting him.

Mrs. Whitcomb is a contributor to the magazines and in addition, has
written "Odd Little Lass," "Freshman and Senior," "Majorbanks," "His
Best Friend," "Pen's Venture," "Queer As She Could Be," and "Curly
Head."

She is a graduate of the University of Vermont and the Boston University
Law School and was the first woman to lecture before a man's law school.




MYRA WILLIAMS JARRELL.


Myra Williams Jarrell, the daughter of the late Archie L. Williams, for
thirty years, the attorney for the Union Pacific Railway in Kansas, and
the grand-daughter of Judge Archibald Williams, the first United States
Circuit Judge of Kansas, appointed by Lincoln, comes of a literary
family. All of the men and some of the women on the father's side of the
family and also, on the mother's to a great extent, had literary talent.

As a child, she cherished an ambition to write and when occasionally one
of her letters to St. Nicholas saw publication, she felt she had crossed
the Alps of her desire. Her first real story, however, was written as
she rocked the cradle of her first born. The day, when she first saw her
"stuff" in print, stands out in her memory second only to the hallowed
days of her personal history, her wedding day and the days upon which
her children were born.

Since then, Mrs. Jarrell has contributed to almost all the high class
magazines and has furnished special feature articles to newspapers.

Some years ago, a small book, "Meg, of Valencia," was written and now, a
novel, "The Hand of The Potter" is ready for publication.

In 1894, Myra Williams and J. F. Jarrell were married. This union was
blest with four children, three sons and one daughter. Mr. Jarrell is
Publicity Agent of the Santa Fe. A number of years ago, he bought the
Holton Signal and in trying to help her husband put some individuality
into the paper, Mrs. Jarrell began a department headed "Ramblings."
Later this was syndicated and finally issued in book form.

Last winter, a play, "The Plain Clothes Man," was produced by the North
Brothers Stock Co., at the Majestic Theatre, Topeka. This well written
play, with its novel and original characterization and its effective
comedy lines, is now in the hands of two New York play brokers. Before
many months, Mrs. Jarrell will be enjoying a royalty.

In preparation, are two plays, as yet nameless; also, a play in
collaboration with Mr. North of the North Stock Co. With her brother,
Burus L. Williams, of Kansas City, Mo., Mrs. Jarrell has written an
opera, "The Mix Up in the Kingdom of Something-Like," which awaits only
the lyrics Mr. Williams is writing and the music. An opera, "The Kingdom
of Never Come True," also, in collaboration with Mr. Williams, is being
set to music by Arthur Pryor, the bandmaster.

A serial story, "John Bishop, Farmer," a collaboration with Albert T.
Reed, the artist, is to be published soon in the Kansas Farmer. Later,
this will appear in book form. A novel, which Mrs. Jarrell believes will
be her best work, is in construction and is clamoring to be written.




ELLEN PALMER ALLERTON.


Ellen Palmer Allerton, the sweet and gentle poetess, beloved of Kansas,
lived at Padonia, in Brown County, when she wrote her famous poem, "Wall
of Corn."

She was past her prime when she came to Kansas from the Wisconsin home,
the subject of many of her noble gems. As she grew older, she grew
stronger in poetic strength.

Three volumes of poems have been published, "Walls of Corn and Other
Poems," "Annabel and Other Poems," and "Poems of the Prairie." Her
"Walls of Corn," written in 1884, famous from the first, as used as
railroad immigration advertising, was translated in several languages
and distributed all over Europe. This and her "Trail of Forty-nine"
are her best, although the classic beauty of "Beautiful Things" is
unsurpassed by any other American writer.

     "Beautiful twilight, at set of sun,
     Beautiful goal, with race well run,
     Beautiful rest, with work well done."

is a fitting close to the beautiful, useful life of the author.

Mrs. Allerton was born in Centerville. New York, in 1835 and began
writing verse at the age of seventeen. Much as she has written,
yet writing was only a pastime. She never let it interfere with her
housework. Thoroughly practical, she did all her own work, just because
she loved to do it. Her flowers of which she had many, in doors and out,
resulted in many noble, inspiring lines. In 1862, she was

married to A. B. Allerton of Wisconsin, coming to Kansas in 1865.
She was best appreciated for her social qualities and her interest in
charity--that broader charity that praises the beauty and ignores the
blemishes. Her last poem, "When Days Grow Dark" is a beautiful pen
picture of her sweetness and resignation in her growing blindness and
her love and trust in him who had been her companion down the years.

     "You take the book and pour into my ear
        In accent sweet, the words I cannot see;
     I listen charmed, forget my haunting fear,
        And think with you as with your eyes I see.
     In the world's thought, so your dear voice be left,
        I still have part, I am not all bereft.

     And if this darkness deepens, when for me
        The new moon bends no more her silver rim,
     When stars go out, and over land and sea
        Black midnight falls, where now is twilight dim,
     O, then may I be patient, sweet and mild,
        While your hands lead me like a little child!"


She died in 1893, at Padonia, and was buried in a bed of her favorite
white flowers, donated by loving friends. In the little graveyard at
Hamlin, one reads "Beautiful Things" on a modest stone at the head of
her little bed.




EMMA TANNER WOOD.


Mrs. Emma Tanner Wood (Caroline Cunningham), a Topeka woman, began
newspaper work in 1872. The result of those early years' work was
"Spring Showers," a volume of prose. After thirty years of study and
experience among the defectives, she wrote "Too Fit For The Unfit,"
advocating surgery for the feeble-minded. The story of Mrs. Benton, one
of the characters, led Mrs. Wood to introduce a law preventing children
being sent to the poor house. This was the first law purely in the
interest of children ever passed in Kansas. Later, a law preventing
traveling hypnotists from using school children as subjects in public
exhibitions was drawn up by Mrs. Wood and passed.

Several years ago, a book on hypnotism, far in advance of the public
thought, was written and is to be published this year.

Mrs. Wood is seventy years young and as she says: "finds age the very
sweetest part of life. It is no small satisfaction to laugh at the
follies of others and know that you are past committing them. It is
equally delightful to be responsible only to one's self and order one's
life as one chooses. Every day is a holy day to me now and the sweetness
of common things, grass, flowers, neighborly love, grand-children, and
home comforts fill me with satisfaction. To think kindly of all things
under the sun (but sin); to speak kindly to all; to do little kindly
acts is a greater good to the world at large than we think while we are
in the heat of battle."




CORNELIA M. STOCKTON.


A cheerful little room in the East wing of St. Margaret's Hospital,
Kansas City, Kansas; an invalid chair wheeled up to a window over
looking the street; and the eager, expectant face and the warm hand
clasp of the occupant, Mrs. Cornelia M. Stockton, assures the visitor of
a hearty welcome.

Greatly enfeebled by long illness and with impaired sight, this bright,
little woman's keen interest in current events and the latest "best
seller" puts to shame the half-hearted zeal of the average woman.

For four years, Mrs. Stockton has lived at St. Margaret's, depending
upon the visits of friends and the memory of an eventful life to pass
the days. Prominence in club work in her earlier years has brought
reward. The History Club of Kansas City, Kansas, of which she was once a
member, each week sends a member to read to her and these are red letter
days to this brave, patient, little woman.

Mrs. Stockton began writing very young. When a little girl, back in the
village of Walden, New York, she stole up to the pulpit of the church
and wrote in her pastor's Bible:

     "I have not seen the minister's eyes,
       And cannot describe his glance divine,
     For when he prays he shuts them up
       And when he preaches he shuts mine."


She was born in 1833 in Shawangunk, New York, and came to Kansas City in
1859, living in Missouri some years but most of the time in Kansas City,
Kansas.

In 1892, she published a limited edition of poems, "The Shanar Dancing
Girl and Other Poems." dedicated to Mrs. Bertha M. Honore Palmer, her
ideal of the perfect type of gracious and lovely womanhood. "The Shanar
Dancing Girl" was first written for the Friends in Council, a literary
club of Kansas City, Mo. It has received the encomiums of Thomas Bailey
Aldrich, John J. Ingalls and others for its beauty of expression and
dramatic qualities. "Invocation," an April idyl; "The Sea-shell;" and
"Mountain Born" sing of the love of nature. "In the Conservatory;" "My
Summer Heart;" and "Tired of the Storm" hint of sorrow and unrest and
longing. Then in 1886, "Compensation" was written. "Irma's Love For
The King" is a favorite; also, "'Sold'--A Picture," written for her
daughter, "yes, but she never came.

"The Sorrowful Stone" Mrs. Stockton considers her best.

     "The story without a suspicion of rhyme,
       And dim with the mists of the morning of Time,
     Is told of a goddess, who, wandering alone,
       Did go and sit down on the Sorrowful Stone.

     We find our Gethsemane somewhere,
       though late;
     The Angel of Shadows
       throws open the gate.
     We creep with our burden of pain,
       to atone,
     For all of life's ills,
       to the Sorrowful Stone.

     Above is the vault of the pitiless stars;
        The trees stretch their arms all blackened
          with scars;
        The gales of lost Paradise are faintly
          blown
        To where we sit down on the Sorrowful
          Stone."

     "From a Poem 'Vagaries'" warns of * * *
        --the product of the age and clime,
        We do too much! grow old before our
          time,

        Yet--would we stray to Morning Hills
          again?
        Unlearn sad prophecies, and dream as
          then!

        Ah, no! with sense of peace the shadows
          creep,
        There droppeth on tired eyes the spell of
          sleep--

        We left the dawn long leagues behind, and
          stand,
        Waiting and wistful in the Evening Land!

        The patient Nurse of Destiny, at best,
        Leads us like children to the needed rest!


     A ghostly wind puts out our little light,
        And we have bid the busy world "Good Night!"


Mrs. Stockton was married twice. Her first husband was the father of her
two sons, one of whom, Dr. Henry M. Downs, in his practice, came often
to St. Margaret's. The second marriage, as the wife of the late Judge
John S. Stockton, was a very happy one. Last year, a brother the only
surviving member of her family, died, leaving Mrs. Stockton the last of
a family of five children. The two sons have also passed into the Great
Beyond.

In her younger days, she contributed many poems and some prose to
newspapers and magazines over the name of Cora M. Downs.

Ex-Gov. St. John appointed her one of the regents of the University of
Kansas.

Her beautiful poem: "In Memoriam" to Sarah Walter Chandler Coates was
her last.

        "'We seem like children,' she was wont to
          say,
        'Talking of what we cannot understand,'
     And in the dark or daylight, all the way,
        Holding so trustfully a Father's hand.
     And this was her religion, not to dwell
        On tenets, creeds, or doctrines, but to
          live
     On a pure faith, and striving to do well
        The simple duties that each hour should
          give."




MARGARET HILL McCARTER.


The most successful Kansas woman writer financially and the most
prolific is Margaret Hill McCarter of Topeka. From the advent of her
little book in 1901, "A Bunch of Things, Tied Up With Strings" to
the hearty reception of her latest novel every step of the way spells
success.

Margaret Hill was born in Indiana and came to Kansas in 1888 to teach
English in the Topeka High School. Two years later, she became the wife
of Dr. William McCarter. Of this union there are two daughters, students
at Baker University and the Topeka High School and a young son, his
mother's literary critic.

A wife and a mother first, a Kansas woman second, and an author third is
the way Mrs. McCarter rates herself. She is capable of and does do all
her housework.

Her love for literature she owes to her mother, who believed in higher
education and taught Margaret to prize the few books that came her way.

After leaving the school room, the teacher instinct still strong within
her, she argued if she could teach out of books written by others,
why not out of books of her own? Then followed poems, short stories,
biography, textbooks, the editing of Crane Classics, "One Hundred Kansas
Women" and miscellanies.

In 1902, "Cuddy and Other Folks" was written and in 1903, "The
Cottonwood's Story."

This same year, "The Overflowing Waters," the story of the 1903 flood,
and one of her best bits of heart writing paid for the school books of
almost a thousand unfortunate children. "Cuddy's Baby" appeared in
1908, followed the next year with "In Old Quivera," a thread of Coronado
history. "The Price of The Prairies," three weeks after publication in
the fall of 1910, became Kansas' best seller. "The Peace of The Solomon
Valley" came out in 1911 and proved a popular gift book. "The Wall of
Men," Mrs. McCarter's 1912 offering should be one of the required books
in Kansas schools. It is authentic history and the close of the story
leaves every Kansan with a greater respect and love for the state and
the heroic pioneers who stood as a living wall between Kansas and the
slave question. 1913 gave us the "Master's Degree," considered by many
her best work. This year we have "Winning The Wilderness."

Mrs. McCarter founded the Club Member and organized the Sorosis, serving
as president seven years and two terms as president of the Topeka
Federation of Women's Clubs. Baker University, at Baldwin, Kansas,
gave her an honorary Master's Degree in 1909, its semi-centennial
anniversary.




BESSIE MAY BELLMAN. and JUNE BELLMAN HENTHORNE.


Bessie May Bellman and June Bellman Henthorne, her daughter, hail from
Winfield. They write both prose and verse and Mrs. Henthorne was a
reporter for years. Mrs. Bellman, when a girl, lived five years on a
cattle ranch and to those five lonely years she credits her habit of
introspection, meditation and writing. Much of her poetry and short
stories are used in platform work.

Red Leaves.

     Red leaves--
          Aflame in the air, aflame in the trees.
        Blue streams, smoky hills--
          Gold, gold the sunlight spills--
             Red leaves!

Dead Leaves--

          A swirl in the air-asleep 'neath the
             trees.
        Gone every lark and swallow--
          Haunting echoes bid me follow--
             Dead leaves!
                  Bessie May Bellman--


Mrs. Henthorne's "If" is published in a New York reader.

     "If, in a bird-heart, beating 'neath the gray
        There chants a song, no matter what the
          day.
     If, in a bird-heart happy sunbeams shine,
             Why not in mine?

     If, in a flower-face, beat down by rain,
        The hope of clear skies be in spite of
          pain--
     If, in a flower-face a great hope shine,
             Why not in mine?"




AMANDA T. JONES.


One of the few Kansas women to have a place in "Who's Who" was the late
Amanda T. Jones of Junction City. She was one of the most prolific poets
of Kansas.

Her "Atlantic" is a story of the rebellion; "Utah and Other Poems;" "A
Prairie Idyl;" "Flowers and a Weed;" and "Rubaiyat of Solomon Valley"
are volumes of verse. Her prose: "Children's Stories," "Fairy Arrows"
and "The White Blackbird;" "A Psychic Autobiography," published in 1908;
"Man and Priest," a story of psychic detection; "Mother of Pioneers,"
and a novel ready for publication, "A Daughter of Wall St."

Miss Jones originated a working women's home and patented many
inventions, mostly household necessities.

CHARLOTTE F. WILDER.


Charlotte Frances Wilder, Manhattan, has been writing half a century and
it has won for her a place in Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, "entitled
to go down to posterity, her lifework preserved as information for
future generations." She has written "Land of The Rising Sun,"
"Sister Ridenour's Sacrifice," "Christmas Cheer In All Lands," "Easter
Gladness," "Mission Ships," "The Child's Own Book" and "The Wonderful
Story of Jesus." Her essays, alone, would make a volume, original and
interesting. She has written for the press since sixteen years of age
and has been a Bible teacher forty years.




ANNA L. JANUARY.


Osawatomie claims Anna L. January, the author of "Historic Souvenir of
Osawatomie, Kansas," "John Brown Battle Grounds," "Calvin Monument," and
"Lookout and Park;" also, numerous poems.

Mrs. January is a native of Wilmington, Ohio, coming to Kansas in 1898.
She taught school three years and in 1901 married D. A. January of
Osawatomie. They have one child, a son of four years. An active worker
in the Congress of Mothers and interested in temperance and suffrage
work, Mrs. January still finds time to write many short poems.




HATTIE HORNER LOUTHAN.


Hattie Horner Louthan, a former White Water, Kansas girl, is the author
of five books and many contributions to newspapers and first class
magazines. After graduation at the Normal School, Emporia, in 1883,
Miss Horner engaged in teaching and literary work. Ten years later, she
became the wife of Overton Earl Louthan, who died in 1906.

She is editor of the Great Southwest and a member of the staff of the
Denver Republican. Her first volume of poems came out in 1885; the next
year, "Some Reasons For Our Choice." "Not At Home," a book of travels,
was published in 1889; "Collection of Kansas Poetry," in 1891; and
"Thoughts Adrift," in 1902. Her work is versatile; the rhyme easy
flowing and strong.



GEORGIANA FREEMAN McCOY. and MARY FREEMAN STARTZMAN.


Georgiana Freeman McCoy, Wichita, has taught music in Kansas longer
than any other teacher in the state and incidentally writes verse. She
remodeled Elizabeth Browning's "A Drama of Exile" and wrote the musical
setting for Simon Buchhalter, the Viennese pianist and composer. A

MARGARET PERKINS.


As a 1914 Christmas offering, Margaret Perkins, a Hutchinson High School
teacher, gave us her volume of beautiful poems. "The Love Letters of a
Norman Princess" is the love story, in verse, of Hersilie, a ward
and relative of William, The Conqueror, and Eric, a kinsman of the
unfortunate King Harold.

     "I thought once, in a dream, that Love
          came near
        With silken flutter of empurpled wings
     That wafted faint, strange fragrance from
          the things
        Abloom where age and season never
          sear.
     The joy of mating birds was in my ear,
        And flamed my path with dancing daffodils
     Whose splendor melted into greening hills
        Upseeking, like my spirit, to revere."



     "Before you came, this heart of mine
        A fairy garden seemed
     With lavender and eglantine;
        And lovely lilies gleamed
     Above the purple-pansy sod
        Where ruthless passion never trod."



     "If Heaven had been pleased to let you be
        A keeper of the sheep, a peasant me,
     Within a shepherd's cottage thatched with
          vine
        Now might we know the bliss of days
          divine."
     --"We are part of Heaven's scheme,
        You and I:
     Child of sunshine and the dew
        I was earthly--born as you.



     "Yet my little hour I go,
        Troubled maid,
     Even where the storm blasts blow,
        Unafraid;
     Confident that from the sod
        All things upward wend to God."



        "Dear heart, the homing hour is here,
          The task is done.
        Toilers, and they who course the deer
          Turn, one by one,
          At day's demise,
        Where dwells a deathless glow
          In loving eyes.
        I hear them hearthward go
     To castle, or to cottage on the lea;
     But him I love comes never home to me."



        The peaks that rift the saffron sheen
          Of sunset skies
        In purple loveliness, when seen
          By nearer eyes,
          Are bleakly bare.
        To brave those boulders gray
          No climbers dare.
        O, in some future may
     This mountain mass of unfulfilled desires
     Be unto me as yonder haloed spires!"


Miss Perkins is the compiler of "Echoes of Pawnee Rock," and writes
short stories and poems for the magazines. Some of her verse is
published in Woolard's "Father."




ANNA E. ARNOLD.

Anna E. Arnold, Cottonwood Falls, Superintendent of Chase County
Schools, is a thorough Kansan, and a farm product. She was born at
Whiting, Jackson County, but when a very small child, her parents moved
to Chase and all her life since has been spent in that county. Until the
last few years, she lived on a farm.

She is a graduate of the State University and has taught in the grade
and high schools. In 1905, she became a candidate for Superintendent
of Schools of Chase County. Her success and her unusual ability as a
teacher were rewarded by a two to one majority on a close county ticket.
At the second term, she had no opposition and out of 1214 votes cast,
she received all but 29. The present year, after four elections, is her
seventh continuous year as Superintendent of Chase County. In addition
to her official duties, Miss Arnold has written two text-books. Her
"Civics and Citizenship" in 1912 was adopted as the state text-book on
civil government for use in the public schools of Kansas. It is being
used by a large number of womens' clubs. Many outlines for club work on
civic subjects have come from Miss Arnold's pen. Her second textbook,
"A History of Kansas," the first book printed under the new State
Publication Law, has also been adopted by the text-book commission.

Miss Arnold is considered one of the foremost educational leaders of the
state.

Topeka gives us Anna Deming Gray, a writer of negro dialect stories,
stories for children, and some verse. Elizabeth Barr Arthur, has written

Worrall Hudson, wife of the late General J. K. Hudson, former editor of
the Topeka Capital, is author of "Two Little Maids And Their Friends,"
"Esther, The Gentile," and many short stories and poems. Her classic
prose-poem: "In The Missouri Woods" is considered her masterpiece. Mrs.
Sara Josephine Albright, formerly of Topeka, now of Leavenworth, is a
sweet singer of childlife. Her volume of verse, "With The Children" is
lullabies and mother-love poems. A book of stories for children will
soon be ready for publication.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
